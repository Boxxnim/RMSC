CVD burden has continued to increase in most countries since 1990, with trends driven by changing exposures to harmful risk factors, population growth, and population aging. OBJECTIVES: We report estimates of global, national, and subnational CVD burden, including 18 subdiseases and 12 associated modifiable risk factors. We analyzed change in CVD burden from 1990 to 2023 and identified drivers of change including population growth, population aging, and risk factor exposure. METHODS: The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2023 study, a multinational collaborative research study, quantified burden due to 375 diseases including CVD burden and identified drivers of change from 1990 to 2023 using all available data and statistical models. GBD 2023 estimated the population-level burden of diseases in 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2023. RESULTS: CVDs were the leading cause of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and deaths estimated in the GBD. As of 2023, there were 437 million (95% UI: 401 to 465 million) CVD DALYs globally, a 1.4-fold increase from the number in 1990 of 320 million (292 to 344 million). Ischemic heart disease, intracerebral hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, and hypertensive heart disease were the leading cardiovascular causes of DALYs in 2023 globally. As of 2023, age-standardized CVD DALY rates were highest in low and low-middle Socio-demographic Index (SDI) settings and lowest in high SDI settings. The number of CVD deaths increased globally from 13.1 million (95% UI: 12.2 to 14.0 million) in 1990 to 19.2 million (95% UI: 17.4 to 20.4 million) in 2023. The number of prevalent cases of CVD more than doubled since 1990, with 311 million (95% UI: 294 to 333 million) prevalent cases of CVD in 1990 and 626 million (95% UI: 591 to 672 million) prevalent cases in 2023 globally. A total of 79.6% (95% UI: 75.7% to 82.5%) of CVD burden is attributable to modifiable risk factors 347 million [95% UI: 318 to 373 million] DALYs in 2023). Globally, high systolic blood pressure, dietary risks, high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and air pollution were the modifiable risks responsible for most attributable CVD burden in 2023. Since 1990, changes in exposure to modifiable risk factors have had mixed effects on CVD burden, with increases in high body mass index, high fasting plasma glucose, and low physical activity leading to higher burden, while reductions in tobacco usage have mitigated some of these increases. Population growth and population aging were the main drivers of the increasing burden since 1990, adding 128 million (95% UI: 115 to 139 million) and 139 million (95% UI: 126 to 151 million) CVD DALYs to the increase in CVD burden since 1990. CONCLUSIONS: CVD remains the leading cause of disease burden and death worldwide with the greatest burden in low, low-middle, and middle SDI regions. Large variation exists in CVD burden even for countries at similar levels of development, a gap explained substantially by known, modifiable risk factors that are inadequately controlled. The decades-long increase in CVD burden was the result of population growth, population aging, and increased exposure to a subset of risk factors led by metabolic risks.

This paper presents GBD 2023 findings on disease and injury burden and risk-attributable health loss, offering a global audit of the state of world health to inform public health priorities. This work captures the evolving landscape of health metrics across age groups, sexes, and locations, while reflecting on the remaining post-COVID-19 challenges to achieving our collective global health ambitions. METHODS: The GBD 2023 combined analysis estimated years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 375 diseases and injuries, and risk-attributable burden associated with 88 modifiable risk factors. Of the more than 310 000 total data sources used for all GBD 2023 (about 30% of which were new to this estimation round), more than 120 000 sources were used for estimation of disease and injury burden and 59 000 for risk factor estimation, and included vital registration systems, surveys, disease registries, and published scientific literature. Data were analysed using previously established modelling approaches, such as disease modelling meta-regression version 2.1 (DisMod-MR 2.1) and comparative risk assessment methods. Diseases and injuries were categorised into four levels on the basis of the established GBD cause hierarchy, as were risk factors using the GBD risk hierarchy. Estimates stratified by age, sex, location, and year from 1990 to 2023 were focused on disease-specific time trends over the 2010-23 period and presented as counts (to three significant figures) and age-standardised rates per 100 000 person-years (to one decimal place). For each measure, 95% uncertainty intervals [UIs] were calculated with the 2·5th and 97·5th percentile ordered values from a 250-draw distribution. FINDINGS: Total numbers of global DALYs grew 6·1% (95% UI 4·0-8·1), from 2·64 billion (2·46-2·86) in 2010 to 2·80 billion (2·57-3·08) in 2023, but age-standardised DALY rates, which account for population growth and ageing, decreased by 12·6% (11·0-14·1), revealing large long-term health improvements. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) contributed 1·45 billion (1·31-1·61) global DALYs in 2010, increasing to 1·80 billion (1·63-2·03) in 2023, alongside a concurrent 4·1% (1·9-6·3) reduction in age-standardised rates. Based on DALY counts, the leading level 3 NCDs in 2023 were ischaemic heart disease (193 million [176-209] DALYs), stroke (157 million [141-172]), and diabetes (90·2 million [75·2-107]), with the largest increases in age-standardised rates since 2010 occurring for anxiety disorders (62·8% [34·0-107·5]), depressive disorders (26·3% [11·6-42·9]), and diabetes (14·9% [7·5-25·6]). Remarkable health gains were made for communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases, with DALYs falling from 874 million (837-917) in 2010 to 681 million (642-736) in 2023, and a 25·8% (22·6-28·7) reduction in age-standardised DALY rates. During the COVID-19 pandemic, DALYs due to CMNN diseases rose but returned to pre-pandemic levels by 2023. From 2010 to 2023, decreases in age-standardised rates for CMNN diseases were led by rate decreases of 49·1% (32·7-61·0) for diarrhoeal diseases, 42·9% (38·0-48·0) for HIV/AIDS, and 42·2% (23·6-56·6) for tuberculosis. Neonatal disorders and lower respiratory infections remained the leading level 3 CMNN causes globally in 2023, although both showed notable rate decreases from 2010, declining by 16·5% (10·6-22·0) and 24·8% (7·4-36·7), respectively. Injury-related age-standardised DALY rates decreased by 15·6% (10·7-19·8) over the same period. Differences in burden due to NCDs, CMNN diseases, and injuries persisted across age, sex, time, and location. Based on our risk analysis, nearly 50% (1·27 billion [1·18-1·38]) of the roughly 2·80 billion total global DALYs in 2023 were attributable to the 88 risk factors analysed in GBD. Globally, the five level 3 risk factors contributing the highest proportion of risk-attributable DALYs were high systolic blood pressure (SBP), particulate matter pollution, high fasting plasma glucose (FPG), smoking, and low birthweight and short gestation-with high SBP accounting for 8·4% (6·9-10·0) of total DALYs. Of the three overarching level 1 GBD risk factor categories-behavioural, metabolic, and environmental and occupational-risk-attributable DALYs rose between 2010 and 2023 only for metabolic risks, increasing by 30·7% (24·8-37·3); however, age-standardised DALY rates attributable to metabolic risks decreased by 6·7% (2·0-11·0) over the same period. For all but three of the 25 leading level 3 risk factors, age-standardised rates dropped between 2010 and 2023-eg, declining by 54·4% (38·7-65·3) for unsafe sanitation, 50·5% (33·3-63·1) for unsafe water source, and 45·2% (25·6-72·0) for no access to handwashing facility, and by 44·9% (37·3-53·5) for child growth failure. The three leading level 3 risk factors for which age-standardised attributable DALY rates rose were high BMI (10·5% [0·1 to 20·9]), drug use (8·4% [2·6 to 15·3]), and high FPG (6·2% [-2·7 to 15·6]; non-significant). INTERPRETATION: Our findings underscore the complex and dynamic nature of global health challenges. Since 2010, there have been large decreases in burden due to CMNN diseases and many environmental and behavioural risk factors, juxtaposed with sizeable increases in DALYs attributable to metabolic risk factors and NCDs in growing and ageing populations. This long-observed consequence of the global epidemiological transition was only temporarily interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The substantially decreasing CMNN disease burden, despite the 2008 global financial crisis and pandemic-related disruptions, is one of the greatest collective public health successes known. However, these achievements are at risk of being reversed due to major cuts to development assistance for health globally, the effects of which will hit low-income countries with high burden the hardest. Without sustained investment in evidence-based interventions and policies, progress could stall or reverse, leading to widespread human costs and geopolitical instability. Moreover, the rising NCD burden necessitates intensified efforts to mitigate exposure to leading risk factors-eg, air pollution, smoking, and metabolic risks, such as high SBP, BMI, and FPG-including policies that promote food security, healthier diets, physical activity, and equitable and expanded access to potential treatments, such as GLP-1 receptor agonists. Decisive, coordinated action is needed to address long-standing yet growing health challenges, including depressive and anxiety disorders. Yet this can be only part of the solution. Our response to the NCD syndemic-the complex interaction of multiple health risks, social determinants, and systemic challenges-will define the future landscape of global health. To ensure human wellbeing, economic stability, and social equity, global action to sustain and advance health gains must prioritise reducing disparities by addressing socioeconomic and demographic determinants, ensuring equitable health-care access, tackling malnutrition, strengthening health systems, and improving vaccination coverage.

387,,10.1097/TXD.0000000000001633,Subnormothermic Oxygenated Machine Perfusion (24 h) in DCD Kidney Transplantation,"Background. Ex vivo kidney perfusion is an evolving platform that demonstrates promise in preserving and rehabilitating the kidney grafts. Despite this, there is little consensus on the optimal perfusion conditions. Hypothermic perfusion offers limited functional assessment, whereas normothermic perfusion requires a more complex mechanical system and perfusate. Subnormothermic machine perfusion (SNMP) has the potential to combine the advantages of both approaches but has undergone limited investigation. Therefore, the present study sought to determine the suitability of SNMP for extended kidney preservation., Methods. SNMP at 22-25 [degrees]C was performed on a portable device for 24 h with porcine kidneys. Graft assessment included measurement of mechanical parameters and biochemical analysis of the perfusate using point-of-care tests. To investigate the viability of kidneys preserved by SNMP, porcine kidney autotransplants were performed in a donation after circulatory death (DCD) model. SNMP was also compared with static cold storage (SCS). Finally, follow-up experiments were conducted in a subset of human kidneys to test the translational significance of findings in porcine kidneys., Results. In the perfusion-only cohort, porcine kidneys all displayed successful perfusion for 24 h by SNMP, evidenced by stable mechanical parameters and biological markers of graft function. Furthermore, in the transplant cohort, DCD grafts with 30 min of warm ischemic injury demonstrated superior posttransplant graft function when preserved by SNMP in comparison with SCS. Finally, human kidneys that underwent 24-h perfusion exhibited stable functional and biological parameters consistent with observations in porcine organs., Conclusions. These observations demonstrate the suitability and cross-species generalizability of subnormothermic machine perfusion to maintain stable kidney perfusion and provide foundational evidence for improved posttransplant graft function of DCD kidneys after SNMP compared with SCS., (C) 2024 The Authors.

In liver transplantation, advances in ex situ normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) have improved outcomes compared with traditional static cold storage (SCS) in donation after circulatory death (DCD) organs. We aimed to characterize trends in the utilization of NMP versus SCS in DCD liver transplantation in the United States., Methods. This retrospective cohort study used data from the United Network for Organ Sharing database to identify recipient-donor adult liver transplant pairs from DCD donors from January 2016 to June 2022. Utilization of NMP and changes in donor risk index (DRI) and components between NMP and SCS were assessed across transplant year eras (2016-2018, 2019-2020, and 2021-2022). Statistical comparisons were made using the Kruskal-Wallis test or the chi-square test., Results. A total of 3937 SCS and 127 NMP DCD donor transplants were included. Utilization of NMP ranged from ~0.4% to 3.5% from 2016 to 2021 and rose significantly to 11.2% in early 2022. Across transplant eras, median DRI increased significantly for SCS and NMP, but the magnitude of the increase was larger for NMP. With NMP DCDs, there were significant increases in median donor age, national share proportion, and ""cold ischemic time"" over time. Finally, there was a shift toward including higher DRI donors and higher model for end-stage liver disease score transplant recipients with NMP in later transplant eras., Conclusions. In recent years, NMP utilization has increased and expanded to donors with higher DRI and recipients with higher model for end-stage liver disease score at transplant, suggesting increasing familiarity and risk tolerance with NMP technology. As NMP remains a relatively new technique, ongoing study of patient outcomes, organ allocation practices, and utilization patterns is critical., (C) 2024 The Authors.

The optimal perfusate is yet to be established., Methods: We assessed hemodynamic, functional, and metabolic changes of eight paired high-risk human kidneys perfused with either a leukocyte-depleted packed red blood cell (PRBC) or a whole blood (WB) perfusate during a 3-hour EVNP., Results: After a mean cold ischemia time of 54 hours, all kidneys showed high renal blood flow through perfusion. Renal resistance increased for both groups during the first hour and then decreased to similar terminal values. The kidneys perfused with PRBC had 55 ml/min greater renal blood flow (95% confidence interval, 21 to 89; P = 0.004) and higher total urine output (145 versus 25 ml, P = 0.002) compared with the WB group. Urinary acute kidney biomarkers of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and kidney injury molecule-1 were also significantly lower (mean differences of 281 and 2.1 ng/ml, respectively; P < 0.01) in the PRBC perfused kidneys. Compared with PRBC, within-group tissue metabolic profiling revealed a similar (23% versus 18%) but a more pronounced alteration involving (branched chain) amino acid and mitochondrial energy metabolism in the WB group. Similarly, lipid profile temporal changes showed that WB groups were highlighted by elevation of plasma membrane and structure lipids including glycerolipids, sphingolipids, and steroids.

Meanwhile, hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion (HOPE) has been well-established in liver transplantation, showing improved graft and patient outcomes. However, the quality of surgical treatment using HOPE in these non-transplant liver surgeries remains unproven. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An exhaustive literature research and polled analysis to study the efficacy of HOPE for in-situ, ante-situm, ex-situ liver resections for hepatic malignancies were performed. Considering the sufficiency of reported data, the ante-situm liver resection under HOPE for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma was selected to make comparisons focusing on perioperative surgical outcome and long-term oncological outcomes. Control groups were ante-situm liver resection under conventional HP and ante-situm liver resection without conventional HP (relying on total vascular exclusion, TVE). RESULTS: Three publications, reporting two case reports and one case series report, were identified with seven cases altogether. Generally, median hospital stay was 17 (12-30) days, 90-day severe complications occurred 14.3% (1/7) patients, no 90-day mortality was observed, median survival was 14.5 (6-34) months.

Onsite machine perfusion (OMP) might make previously non-utilized organs useable. Comprehensive studies on OMP's safety in LT, using the US national database, are lacking. METHODS: This study aimed to assess OMP usage and implications in LT, using the UNOS database (2016-2023). The impact on recipient outcomes of marginal donor quality as assessed by the donor organ discard index (DSRI) was examined. RESULTS: Of 50,458 LT cases identified, 1263 (2.5 %) utilized OMP. OMP usage had surged since 2022, exceeding a 10.0 % proportion in early 2023 (Jan-June). In DBD, OMP livers had higher median DSRI than non-OMP livers (2.33vs1.73, P < 0.01) but had comparable graft survival (GS). DCD livers had better 90-day/1-year GS when OMP was used despite having a higher DSRI (24.3vs18.6, P < 0.01). For DCD donors with high DSRI (>13), OMP utilization correlated with a significantly lower hazard ratio (HR) than non-utilization. OMP cases with macrosteatosis≥30 % reported no graft failures. OMP did not exhibit a linear increase in HR with donor age. CONCLUSION: OMP's usage in LT significantly increased after its commercialization, offering comparable outcomes with non-OMP despite higher DSRI. It holds promise in optimizing marginal donor use, potentially expanding the donor pool.","Akabane, M.; Bekki, Y.; Kwong, A. J.; Esquivel, C. O.; Kim, W. R.; Melcher, M.

Surgical resection, radiofrequency ablation, trans-arterial chemoembolization, and liver transplantation offer potentially curative treatments for early-stage disease, but recurrence remains high. Most patients present with advanced-stage HCC, where locoregional therapies are less effective, and systemic treatments-primarily multi-kinase inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors-often yield limited responses. Precision medicine aims to tailor therapy to molecular and genetic profiles, yet its adoption in HCC is hindered by inter-/intra-tumoral heterogeneity and limited biopsy availability. Advances in molecular diagnostics support reintroducing tissue sampling to better characterize genetic, epigenetic, and immunological features. Liquid biopsy offers a minimally invasive method for capturing real-time tumor evolution, overcoming spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are revolutionizing biomarker discovery, risk stratification, and treatment planning by integrating multi-omics data. Immunological factors such as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, natural killer cells, macrophages, and fibroblasts have emerged as determinants of HCC progression and treatment response. Conversion therapy-combining systemic agents with locoregional treatments-has showndemonstrated promise in downstaging unresectable HCC. Ongoing efforts to refine biomarker-driven approaches and optimize multi-modality regimens underscore precision medicine's potential to improve outcomes. PubMed (January 2002-February 2025) was searched for relevant studies. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer and continues to be a major health problem worldwide. While early-stage HCC can sometimes be cured with surgery or liver transplantation, most patients are diagnosed when the cancer is advanced. Current treatments for advanced disease often do not work well for many patients.Precision medicine, a new approach that tailors treatments to each patient’s unique genetic makeup and tumor biology, shows promise for improving outcomes in HCC. However, the complex nature of this cancer makes finding effective personalized treatments challenging. Liquid biopsies—a simple blood test to detect cancer cells or genetic material from the tumor—are becoming an important tool. TheyLiquid biopsy can capture thegenetic changes in a tumor over time without the need for repeated invasive biopsies.The immune system’s interaction with cancer is another critical factor in determining how well patients respond to treatments. Recent research has identified that genetic differences between individuals can significantly impact their immune response to tumors.Additionally, new strategies known as conversion therapies—combining medication and targeted local treatments—are helping some patients with advanced HCC undergo surgery that was previously not possible.Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are also improving the identification of important biomarkers and helping doctors select the best treatments for each patient. Overall, continued development in these areas offers hope for more effective and personalized care for patients with liver cancer. eng","Akabane, M.; Imaoka, Y.; Kawashima, J.; Pawlik, T.

This study examined whether outcomes of LT using older DCD (>=50 y) have improved with advancements in surgical/perioperative care and normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) technology. A total of 7602 DCD LT cases from the United Network for Organ Sharing database (2003-2022) were reviewed. The impact of older DCD donors on graft survival was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier and HR analyses. In all, 1447 LT cases (19.0%) involved older DCD donors. Although there was a decrease in their use from 2003 to 2014, a resurgence was noted after 2015 and reached 21.9% of all LTs in the last 4 years (2019-2022). Initially, 90-day and 1-year graft survivals for older DCDs were worse than younger DCDs, but this difference decreased over time and there was no statistical difference after 2015. Similarly, HRs for graft loss in older DCD have recently become insignificant. In older DCD LT, NMP usage has increased recently, especially in cases with extended donor-recipient distances, while the median time from asystole to aortic cross-clamp has decreased. Multivariable Cox regression analyses revealed that in the early phase, asystole to cross-clamp time had the highest HR for graft loss in older DCD LT without NMP, while in the later phases, the cold ischemic time (>5.5 h) was a significant predictor. LT outcomes using older DCD donors have become comparable to those from young DCD donors, with recent HRs for graft loss becoming insignificant. The strategic approach in the recent period could mitigate risks, including managing cold ischemic time (<=5.5 h), reducing asystole to cross-clamp time, and adopting NMP for longer distances.

Severe cases of MSUD often require liver transplantation (LT) to restore metabolic stability and prevent neurological complications. Domino liver transplantation (DLT) using MSUD livers has emerged as an innovative approach to expand the donor pool, leveraging the fact that MSUD-affected livers can function normally in recipients without developing MSUD due to extrahepatic BCKDH activity. METHODS &RESULTS: This study retrospectively reviews the experience at King Fahad Specialist Hospital in Dammam, where seven patients with MSUD underwent LT, with their explanted livers subsequently transplanted into seven other recipients. The results demonstrate the feasibility and safety of this approach, with a 100% survival rate for MSUD patients at a median follow-up of 2.9 years. For the domino recipients, the 3-year graft and patient survival rate was 71.4%, with two graft-related fatalities. CONCLUSION: The study highlights the importance of careful recipient selection, optimal graft-to-recipient weight ratio, and the potential for hybrid dual graft transplantation in cases where graft volume is insufficient. The findings suggest that DLT using MSUD livers is a viable option, particularly in regions with limited deceased donor activity, and should be considered in mature liver transplant programs to address organ shortages.","Al Qahtani, M.; Aloufi, R.; Gaw, E.; Momani, H.; Sengupta, B.; Khan, I.; Hassan, I.; Bader, R.; Abdullah, R.; Tawfeeq, M.; Zidan, A.",2025,Front Immunol,Other,,,,,,,,,,exclude,EXC-4,"This study retrospectively reviews the experience at King Fahad Specialist Hospital in Dammam, where seven patients with MSUD underwent LT, with their explanted livers subsequently transplanted into seven other recipients.

The number of available grafts is limited in relation to the number of children on PLT waiting list. This graft shortage has led transplant societies and healthcare organizations to explore ways to investigate possible options and expand the donor pool. The safe use of grafts from obese donors has always been a subject of debate among PLT specialists. Donors' obesity is strongly associated with hepatic steatosis which can affect graft function by impairing microcirculation and maximizing the potential of ischemia-reperfusion injury. Donor body mass index consideration should go hand in hand with the workup for hepatic steatosis which is an independent predictor for early graft dysfunction. New strategies to optimize the grafts before PLT such as normothermic regional perfusion and ex vivo liver perfusion can potentially mitigate the risk of using grafts from obese donors.

332,40584696.0,10.1016/j.crphys.2025.100150,Enhancing career development for biomedical sciences Students: Leveraging simulations to support patient-facing careers,"Simulations have become integral to medical education for professions such as nursing and medicine but are still a rare opportunity for students undertaking basic science courses including Biomedical Sciences. Many students undertaking Biomedical Sciences have a strong underlying interest in pursuing careers at the patient bedside. In this regard, Biomedical Science students often hope to secure competitive places on postgraduate courses in medicine, or physician associate studies. At the University of Salford, a significant number of students come from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. These students may face additional barriers to academic confidence and a sense of belonging, which can affect their ability to competitively pursue postgraduate opportunities in medicine and related fields. Providing immersive learning experiences, such as clinical simulations, can help bridge this gap by fostering essential skills, increasing confidence, and enhancing employability. We set out to design clinical scenarios that would develop transferable skills, especially around patient consultation, teamwork and ethical decision making. Four clinical scenarios were designed and delivered in the University of Salford state-of-the-art simulations suite. Scenarios included a lung cancer patient consultation, decision making around a liver transplant dilemma, a difficult conversation with a parent regarding safeguarding concerns, and finally an escape-game style scenario involving a zombie virus infection. These scenarios involved students becoming familiar with the ethical pillars for clinical decision making, frameworks for patient consultations, and the basics of clinical observations. We evaluated the student experience using a Likert survey. Over a two-year period, a total of 60 students took part in the extracurricular simulation, of which 31 agreed to take part in the research survey. Results showed that the experience was largely accessed by students from widening participation backgrounds. In total, 97 % had a positive learning experience, and 100 % enjoyed taking part in the clinical simulation. We found that 90 % of students felt the experience supported the development of communication skills and teamwork, whilst 84 % reported improved employability. Furthermore, 90 % of students in this study would like to see simulation experiences embedded into their programme of study, and 91 % thought that simulations were better than traditional dyadic styles. Collectively, these results point to the successful design and delivery of an extracurricular simulated experience and provide evidence to support the need to embed immersive simulated experiences into the curriculum of Biomedical Sciences courses.","Amar, K.; Jones, M.; Connell, N.; Mayo, D.; Forde, L.; Sayan, B.

The advent of normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) has the potential to increase access to transplantation in patients with primary hepatic malignancies. METHODS: Using the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients database, this study evaluated the impact of widespread availability of NMP on access to liver transplantation in transplant oncology. Waitlist outcomes and transplant characteristics between patients with HCC and CCA after the implementation of acuity circles but before the widespread NMP availability (pre-NMP era, February 2020 to September 2021) were compared to those after widespread NMP availability (NMP era, September 2021 to September 2023) based on waitlist date. RESULTS: A total of 7564 patients with HCC (3691 pre-NMP; 3874 NMP era) and 354 patients with CCA (193 pre-NMP; 161 NMP era) were waitlisted over the study period. NMP-era patients had a higher probability of transplant at 1 year from listing for both HCC (59% vs. 49%, p < 0.001) and CCA (71% vs. 56%, p = 0.012). Patients with HCC also had a lower risk of death or waitlist dropout (14% vs. 16% at 1 year, p = 0.016). After adjustment for other factors affecting probability of transplant in HCC, the NMP era (aSHR 1.26, 95% CI 1.18-1.34, p < 0.001) and transplantation at a high-volume NMP center (aSHR 1.13, 95% CI 1.05-1.22, p = 0.002) were both still associated with higher transplant probability.

Transplantation is currently the standard of care for treating many cases of end-stage heart disease, but a shortage of donor hearts has made it difficult to provide transplantation to all patients who may benefit from it. One limitation that causes increased discard of potentially viable organs is the brief time for which an organ is viable. The most common current storage method is static cold storage, which permits up to 4 hours of safe storage time. A newer technology, TransMedics Organ Care System (OCS), permits longer storage time via ex vivo perfusion, simulating physiological conditions, and allows a live functional assessment of the heart. Several clinical trials have evaluated the transplant success and survival rates, along with rates of adverse effects, of the OCS, with the system showing noninferiority to static cold storage in both metrics, while allowing for increased safe storage time. This makes the system particularly useful for organs donated after brain death, an application for which the system was approved for use in 2021. OCS applications for lung and liver transplantation have also been investigated, with similar benefits being observed in the transplantation of these organs. OCS provides a means to vastly increase the donor pool at no expense to organ viability and address the donor organ shortage in healthcare.","Annabi, J.; Bailey, I.; Keeler, A.; Annabi, C.; Frishman, W.

We performed a contemporary analysis of patients undergoing SHLT for CHD vs non-CHD, further exploring the impact of machine perfusion (MP). Patients undergoing SHLT between 2010-2024 were retrospectively identified using the United Network for Organ Sharing database, assessing the primary outcome of patient survival and the secondary outcome of MP utilization. Five hundred thirty-five patients underwent SHLT, 224 (41.9%) with CHD indication and 311 (58.1%) with non-CHD. CHD recipients had significantly lower 1-year (72.9% vs 89.4%, P < .01) and 5-year survival (66.1% vs 81.4%, P < .01) compared to non-CHD recipients. CHD indication was independently associated with a 2-fold increased mortality risk, compared to a non-CHD diagnosis (Hazard Ratio: 2.31, 95% CI: [1.53, 3.47]). Decision tree boosting demonstrated a 2.9% higher relative mortality likelihood after SHLT for recipients with CHD. From 2022-2024, SHLT MP utilization for CHD increased; among 111 patients, 18.0% received an MP liver, 8.1% an MP heart, and 10.8% MP heart and MP liver. In this analysis of modern SHLT cases, patients with CHD had suboptimal outcomes; several donor and recipient factors also impacted mortality. Awareness of these factors can guide pretransplant optimization, donor/recipient matching, and strategic MP use to improve survival.","Anouti, A.; Dakroub, A. H.; Krayem, H.; Matevish, L.

Thoracoabdominal normothermic regional perfusion allows thoracic and abdominal organs to be perfused with warm, oxygenated blood after declaration of death, interrupting ischemia. Evidence is accumulating supporting the use of TA-NRP to improve the outcome of grafts from DCD donors. Thoracoabdominal normothermic regional perfusion may restore and maintain a near-physiological environment during procurement. Moreover, during TA-NRP it is feasible to evaluate the heart in situ . Thoracoabdominal normothermic regional perfusion could be performed through different cannulation techniques, central or peripheral, and, with different extracorporeal circuits. The use of conventional cardiopulmonary bypass and extracorporeal life support (ECLS) devices equipped with open circuits has been described. We report the use of a fully mobile, closed ECLS circuit to implement TA-NRP. The procedure was successfully performed in a peripheral center without a cardiac surgery program through a percutaneous cannulation approach. This strategy resulted in combined heart, liver, and kidney recovery despite a significantly prolonged functional warm ischemia time. The feasibility of TA-NRP using modified but still closed fully mobile ECLS circuits could furtherly support the expansion of DCD programs, increasing the availability of heart for transplantation, and the quality of the grafts, improving recipients' outcome.","Antonini, M.

Providing ex-vivo optimization, NMPP attenuates ischemic insult while replenishing energy. An understanding of machine perfusion time (MPT) impact and potential clinical benefits is paramount and necessitates exploration. AIM: To investigate the relationship between MPT and post-transplant graft function. METHODS: Retrospective review of the first 50 donation after circulatory death (DCD) grafts preserved using NMPP in a tertiary institution was performed. Essential preservation time points, graft parameters, recipient information, and postoperative outcomes were prospectively recorded. Early allograft dysfunction (EAD), L-Graft(7) score and 90-day outcomes were collected for all grafts. The first 20 recipients were allocated into the early group, considered the learning curve population for the center. The subsequent 30 were allocated into the late group. Recipients were also stratified into cohorts depending on MPT, i.e., short (< 8 hours), medium (8-16 hours) and long (> 16 hours). RESULTS: NMPP operational parameters were not predictive of EAD, L-GrAFT(7) or 90-day outcomes. The early group had significantly less MPT and cold ischemia time than the late group (553 minutes vs 850 minutes, P < 0.001) and (127.5 minutes vs 154 minutes, P = 0.025), respectively. MPT had no impact in either group. CONCLUSION: Increased MPT of DCD liver grafts had no adverse recipient results for the times utilized in this population, indicating its upper limits, likely beyond 24 hours, are not demonstrated within this study. Future studies are necessary to determine whether longer MPT is beneficial or detrimental to graft function and, if the latter, what is the maximum safe duration. Further studies of the effect of normothermic machine perfusion pump duration on long-term outcomes are also needed.","Archie, W.

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the surgical approach on postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) incidence in obese patients undergoing MI-SPDP. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of obese patients from 16 international centres compared robotic (R-SPDP) and laparoscopic (L-SPDP) approaches. Perioperative outcomes and factors associated with clinically relevant POPF were analysed using univariate and multivariate methods. RESULTS: Among 130 patients (57L-SPDP, 73R-SPDP), POPF incidence was significantly lower in the robotic group (15.1% vs. 42.1%; p = 0.001). The Comprehensive Complications Index was also lower (8% vs. 15%; p = 0.002). Laparoscopic approach (OR = 4.0), pancreatic body transection (OR = 2.6), and non-stapler stump closure (OR = 3.2) were independently associated with higher POPF rates. DISCUSSION: Robotic MI-SPDP reduces POPF in obese patients. Transection at the pancreatic neck and stapler-based closure can improve outcomes.","Ausania, F.; Landi, F.; González-Abós, C.; Martinie, J. B.; Vrochides, D.; Walsh, M.; Hossain, S.

This is paralleled by a supposed increased risk of allograft failure (AF) at 90 and 365 days. This study has been designed to portray the LT practice worldwide and investigate models of AF prediction and the impact of risk mitigation strategies for further improving graft and patient outcomes. This is a multicenter, international, non-competitive, observational two segment study on consecutive LTs over two periods (2017-2019 and 2022-2024). A steering committee of LT experts defined the study protocol. The prospective segment will enroll 750 patients from 15 high-volume LT centers (50 per center), and the retrospective segment will enrol 4200 patients from 56 LT centers (75 per center). To provide a snapshot of the LT activity globally and to develop new algorithms for the timely prediction of AF at 90 and 365 days post-LT. The study also aims (1) to validate the existing predictive models and (2) to investigate the best time for re-transplantation, paying attention to the differences in AF and Ischemic cholangiopathy according to the donor types and mitigation strategies implemented in the various settings. Since the adoption of machine perfusion has increased in different proportions worldwide, models will be adjusted according to this parameter. Finally, retrospective and prospective data will be available for further stratifications and modelling according to the degree of decompensation at transplant, gender match, postoperative complications and their management. This protocol was approved by Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS Ethics Committee (study ID: 4571) and the Institutional Review Board of the University of California, Los Angeles.

She presented with a single liver recurrence on the left liver remnant invading the middle and the left hepatic veins. Upon multidisciplinary board meeting, surgery was indicated. An upper transversal hepatectomy resecting the tumor and the left and middle hepatic veins was planned. The liver was fully mobilized, VVB cannulas were placed (inferior mesenteric veins, axillary vein, and femoral vein). During parenchymal transection, the hepatic veins truncks were isolated far from the tumor. TVE was started and two additional cannulas were placed into the two hepatic veins to ensure venous drainage through the VVB. The liver was rotated toward the left, as per an ante situm approach, while continuously perfused by the hepatic pedicle and drained through the VVB. Hepatic veins (HVs) and the tumor were resected en bloc. Hepatic vein reconstruction was made sequentially by using one cryopreserved femoral graft anastomosed between the two HVs and the anterior face of the IVC. RESULTS: Postoperative course was uneventful, and pathology confirmed an isolated liver recurrence of leiomyosarcoma; 4 years later, the patient is alive and disease free. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatectomy with hepatic vein resection and reconstruction can be performed without cold perfusion and venous drainage through the VVB. This technical variant integrates safely into the armamentarium of extreme liver surgery.","Bachellier, P.; de Mathelin, P.; Addeo, P.",2025,Ann Surg Oncol,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
255,40881762.0,10.5500/wjt.v15.i3.104109,Optimizing liver utilization for transplantation with partial grafts undergoing normothermic machine perfusion: Two case reports,"BACKGROUND: Liver transplantation (LT) is the only curative, life-saving option for children and adults with end-stage liver disease. Due to the well-known shortage and heterogeneity of grafts, split LT (SLT) is an attractive strategy to expand the donor pool and reduce waitlist times. Given increased risk of cold ischemia time with SLT, machine perfusion represents a promising option to reduce it and optimize transplant logistics and outcomes. The present communication describes various possible combinations of procurement steps to perform SLT facilitated by placing one or both grafts on a normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) closed circuit device. CASE SUMMARY: A 19-month-old female with biliary atresia after failed Kasai portoenterostomy and a 42-year-old woman with unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma were selected as recipients for a SLT from a 17-year-old male donor. The SLT generated a left lateral segment and a right trisectional graft of appropriate volume for both recipients. After a mixed in-situ and ex-situ split, in order to improve logistics, the right trisectional graft was placed on a closed circuit NMP device, following an appropriate vascular reconstruction. Both grafts were implanted with excellent short-term outcomes. CONCLUSION: Use of NMP with SLT for preservation prior to implantation allows not only for graft optimization but also for significant improvement of transplant logistics. We propose various models and standardization of logistic options for combining SLT with NMP to optimize graft availability and outcomes.","Baimas-George, M.; Archie, W. H.; Soltys, K.; Soto, J.

Historically grafts from DCD donors were used with caution due to complication rates, but new techniques have led to significant strides in utilization. Normothermic regional perfusion (NRP) establishes in situ perfusion after circulatory death pronouncement, mitigating ischemic injury seen with classic cold perfusion. NRP has shown excellent clinical outcomes and the potential for significant donor pool expansion. METHODS: For every NRP case, our team consists of two perfusionists, one transplant surgeon, and one surgical assistant. Communication between team members as well as an organized setup of the mayo stand and perfusion system are crucial for success. Cases proceed in the following fashion: sternotomy incision and retractor placement, pericardial incision and innominate vein ligation, occlusion of the brachiocephalic arteries, venous cannula insertion, aortic cannula insertion, and initiation of NRP. RESULTS: Since October 2022, our center has utilized NRP for all DCD cases when possible, leading to 128 attempts, of which 108 progressed to cardiac death, resulting in 94 liver transplants. CONCLUSIONS: Thoracic cannulation can be challenging, particularly in the hands of an abdominal transplant surgeon unfamiliar with the territory. The evolution of technique and strategy has permitted reliable results and desired outcomes to allow for proper and efficient cannulation.

This study compares LFT changes following elective biliary and non-biliary laparoscopic procedures to determine if the laparoscopic approach itself, rather than underlying biliary pathology, contributes to these alterations. METHODS: This prospective, observational study (July 2023 to June 2024) included 116 American Society of Anesthetists (ASA) grades I and II patients undergoing laparoscopic procedures with normal preoperative LFTs. Exclusion criteria included pre-existing liver disease or conversion to open surgery. The LFTs (aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and bilirubin) were measured preoperatively, at 24 hours, and 72 hours postoperatively. Statistical analysis included Friedman ANOVA, t-tests, and repeated measures ANOVA to compare LFT changes between groups and assess the effect of surgical duration. RESULTS: A total of 90 patients underwent a biliary procedure, while 26 patients had a non-biliary procedure. Significant postoperative changes in LFTs were observed, with total bilirubin (TB), AST, ALT, ALP, and GGT significantly increasing at 24 hours (p<0.001) before declining at 72 hours. Preoperative TB and GGT were higher in the biliary group (p=0.034 and p=0.023, respectively). The AST was significantly higher at 24 hours for biliary procedures (p <0.001), with a similar level at baseline. Procedure duration showed a significant association with GGT levels at 24 hours only (p=0.031). CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic surgery results in transient derangement of LFTs, peaking at 24 hours postoperatively, irrespective of biliary or non-biliary indication. These findings underscore the importance of recognizing this transient effect and suggest routine intervention based solely on these changes may be unwarranted.","Baksh, S.

Here, we report on the results of the phase 1 clinical trial of BTX A51 in patients with relapsed or refractory AML and MDS. METHODS: Adult patients with R/R AML and high-risk MDS were enrolled into eight potential doses ranging from 1 to 42 mg dosed orally three days/week for 21 or 28 days out of a 28-day cycle. The maximum tolerated dose, recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of BTX A51 were investigated. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were enrolled and received treatment with BTX A51. Median age was 75 (range 22- 84) and 55% were male. Most patients (97%) had received prior treatment with venetoclax and hypomethylating agents. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events of any grade were nausea (67%), emesis (63%), hypokalemia (53%), and diarrhea (40%). Two patients experienced hepatic toxicity as DLTs, which resolved upon holding treatment. No treatment-related deaths occurred. The recommended phase 2 dose was 21 mg dosed three days/week for 4 weeks of a 28-day cycle. BTX A51 increased the expression of p53 and reduced the expression of MCL1 and RNA polymerase II phosphorylation in pre- and post-treatment immunocytochemistry studies. Overall, 3 patients (10%) experienced complete remission with incomplete count recovery (CRi). All 3 responding patients had RUNX1 mutations and the CR/CRi rate for RUNX1-mutated patients receiving BTX A51 at efficacious doses (11 mg or higher) was 30%. Ex-vivo studies confirmed higher efficacy of BTX A51 on RUNX1-mutated myeloblasts and demonstrated synergy with azacitidine and venetoclax. CONCLUSIONS: Although the overall efficacy was modest, this study lays the groundwork for future studies with improved patient selection and combination approaches.

Many potentially viable organs from brain-dead deceased donors (DBDs) are discarded due to uncertainties surrounding donor suitability in specific clinical scenarios. To address this gap, the Indian Society of Organ Transplantation (ISOT) convened a panel of national experts to develop a Delphi consensus statement aimed at guiding transplant professionals on the feasibility of organ donation from DBDs, particularly in complex or marginal donor situations. This position statement presents 19 consensus recommendations based on real-world clinical contexts such as extremes of age, acute kidney injury, infections (including HCV, HBV, HIV, tuberculosis, and tropical diseases), malignancy, diabetes, hypertension, and various surgical anomalies. The guidance is grounded in available literature, registry data, and extensive clinical experience, with the aim of expanding the DBD donor pool across Asia and improving access to transplantation for patients with end-stage organ failure. The consensus does not function as a formal clinical guideline but rather as a practical reference tool, acknowledging the limitations in India-specific data and the contextual differences from Western transplant settings. It encourages critical care and transplant teams to perform structured assessments of organ viability, apply ethical principles, and pursue informed consent in line with local regulations.","Balwani, M.

We aimed to identify predictive biomarkers in DCD grafts subjected to NRP, followed by randomization to either normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) or dual hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (D-HOPE). Methods: Among 57 DCD donors, 32 liver grafts were transplanted, and recipients were monitored for one week post-transplant. Biomarkers linked with oxidative stress, hepatic injury, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, regeneration, and autophagy were measured during NRP, end-ischemic MP, and one week post-transplant. Results: Arginase-1 (ARG-1) levels were consistently higher in discarded grafts and in recipients who later developed early allograft dysfunction (EAD). Specifically, ARG-1 levels at the end of MP correlated with markers of hepatic injury. Receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated that ARG-1 at the end of MP had a good predictive accuracy for EAD (AUC = 0.713; p = 0.02). Lipid peroxidation (TBARS) elevated at the start of NRP, declined over time, with higher levels in D-HOPE than in NMP, suggesting a more oxidative environment in D-HOPE. Metabolites like flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and NADH exhibited significant disparities between perfusion types, due to differences in perfusate compositions. Inflammatory biomarkers rose during NRP and NMP but normalized post-transplantation. Regenerative markers, including osteopontin and hepatocyte growth factor, increased during NRP and NMP and normalized post-transplant. Conclusions: ARG-1 demonstrates strong potential as an early biomarker for assessing liver graft viability during perfusion, supporting timely and effective decision-making in transplantation.","Basta, G.; Babboni, S.; Pezzati, D.; Del Turco, S.; Balzano, E.; Catalano, G.; Russo, L.; Tincani, G.; Carrai, P.; Petruccelli, S.; Bronzoni, J.; Martinelli, C.; Palladino, S.; Trizzino, A.; Petagna, L.; Romagnoli, R.; Patrono, D.; Biancofiore, G.; Peris, A.; Lazzeri, C.; Ghinolfi, D.",2025,Biomedicines,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since then, ex situ machine perfusion (es-MP) and normothermic regional perfusion (NRP) have been introduced in the United States. METHODS: Liver graft utilization rates were analyzed using the US national registry data from 2022 to 2024. The associations of es-MP and NRP practices with donation after circulatory death (DCD) utilization rates among organ procurement organizations (OPOs) and transplant center volume were evaluated. RESULTS: DCD donor utilization significantly increased from 21.5% in 2022 to 42.5% in 2024 (P < 0.001). Utilization of extended criteria donors (ECDs), including DCD donors aged ≥60 y or with a body mass index ≥40 kg/m2, also rose substantially, from 7.1% in 2022 to 33.2% in 2024 (P < 0.001). At the transplant center level, a significant correlation was found between the increase in transplant volume and both the es-MP use (r = 0.29; P = 0.01) and ECD utilization (r = 0.26; P = 0.02). At the OPO level, a significant association was observed between the increase in DCD utilization rate and NRP use (r = 0.29; P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: DCD liver utilization has significantly increased, with a notable rise in the utilization of ECDs, which may be driven by new technologies such as es-MP and NRP. While es-MP at the center level use may increase transplant volume, NRP use at the OPO level appears to significantly improve DCD liver utilization.","Bekki, Y.; Loszko, A.; Endo, Y.; Lim, N.; Nakayama, T.; Sasaki, K.; Tomiyama, K.; Hernandez-Alejandro, R.",2025,Transplantation,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
195,40746840.0,10.3389/fsurg.2025.1608467,The evolving role of liver transplantation for metastatic colorectal cancer: current perspectives and future directions,"Liver transplantation is increasingly being explored as a treatment option for select patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Historically, transplantation for mCRC was abandoned due to poor long-term outcomes and high recurrence rates. However, recent advancements in patient selection, immunosuppressive strategies, and donor organ availability have led to a renewed interest in this approach. Studies have demonstrated that highly selected patients undergoing liver transplantation can achieve significantly improved survival rates compared to those receiving standard systemic therapies. The implementation of Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) exception points, improved donor preservation techniques such as machine perfusion, and the growing role of living donor liver transplantation have further supported its feasibility. As research continues, liver transplantation may emerge as a crucial component of a multidisciplinary strategy for treating colorectal liver metastases, offering a select group of patients a chance at prolonged survival and improved quality of life.","Bendersky, V.

We compared early (90-day) and mid-term (3-year) graft outcomes after DCD versus donation-after-brain-death (DBD) heart transplantation in ACHD recipients. METHODS: Using the United Network for Organ Sharing registry (1 January 2018 - 1 April 2025), we identified adults (≥18 y) with ACHD undergoing isolated heart transplantation. Retransplants and multiorgan procedures were excluded. The primary endpoint was graft failure (death or retransplant). Survival was analysed with Kaplan-Meier curves, multivariable Cox models, and 1:1 nearest-neighbor propensity-score matching (caliper = 0.25 SD) adjusting for donor and recipient age, sex, body-mass index, renal and hepatic function, support devices, listing status, prior sternotomy, and regional ACHD center volume. RESULTS: Among 726 ACHD transplants, 61 (8.4%) used DCD grafts and 665 (91.6%) used DBD grafts. Baseline clinical characteristics were similar, although DCD grafts had longer ischemic times (median 5.3 h vs 3.8 h, p < 0.001) and more frequent exvivo perfusion (65% vs 5.8%). Unadjusted 90-day and 3-year graft survival were lower after DCD (log-rank p = 0.009 and 0.040, respectively). On multivariable analysis, DCD procurement remained an independent risk factor for graft failure at 90 days (HR 2.56, 95% CI 1.23-5.17) and 3 years (HR 2.11, 95% CI 1.03-3.50).Propensity-matched analysis (n = 148) confirmed inferior 90-day survival for DCD recipients (log-rank p = 0.020). Post-operative morbidity and length of stay did not differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS: In the early US experience, ACHD recipients of DCD hearts experienced significantly worse short- and mid-term graft survival than those receiving DBD hearts, despite comparable peri-operative morbidity. Until preservation strategies further mitigate warm-ischemic injury, careful candidate selection is warranted when allocating DCD grafts to complex ACHD patients.","Berg, A. R.; Mullis, D.

317,41309085.0,10.2196/55907,A 6-Month Evaluation of the Peer-Ceived Momentary Assessment Method in a Small Sample of Liver Transplant Patients and Their Support Persons: Longitudinal Observational Study,"BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcomes, including ecological momentary assessments (EMAs), are acquired from patients via repeated self-reports of their perceived momentary physical and emotional states before and after medical procedures. Patient-reported outcomes are used to measure health outcomes and quality of care. However, certain observable states or behaviors (eg, moods such as fatigue, hope, or medication adherence), or behaviors suggestive of health decline (eg, depression, cognitive decline), are not easily measured via self-reports in certain situations (eg, patients undergoing certain medical procedures, patients with dementia, and others). The peer-ceived momentary assessment (PeerMA) method involves support persons or peers (eg, family members and friends) to report their perception of a patient's subjective physical and emotional states and has been validated in healthy populations. OBJECTIVE: We examined the value of the PeerMA method in assessing the disease progression and recovery pathways of patients undergoing liver transplantation. Herein, the PeerMA method is operationalized via the patient's informal caregivers and the patient-based EMA, and wearable-based physical activity datasets from the patients. We report the feasibility results and human factors influencing the acceptance and reliability of the PeerMA method in a small study comprising 8 patients and support persons. METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal observational study of 6 months (autumn 2019 to spring 2020), collecting EMA/self-reports from 8 patients (at the liver transplant clinic at Stanford University Hospital, California) about their perceived levels of hope, sleep, fatigue, depression, and pain in addition to PeerMA-based reports of the same aspects from 7 caregivers. We collected physical activity records from 5 patients using a Fitbit bracelet. Participants completed pre- and poststudy surveys, contributing qualitative data. We implemented the PeerMA method using a smartphone app, making it easy to use by both patients and support persons. RESULTS: We collected 1142 patient-days and 976 support person-days. On average, each patient received 103 EMAs and responded to 64 (63%) of them, while support persons received 87 PeerMAs and responded to 64 (74%) of them. We report empirical evidence about the methodological feasibility of PeerMA, showing its dual and unique information streams unavailable by EMA alone. We show examples where support person assessments and physical activity data can inform health professionals about the actual state of a patient regarding outcomes such as hope, sleep quality, fatigue, pain, and depression. We discuss human factors influencing the acceptance of the method and make methodological recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to leverage data acquired via the PeerMA method and a wearable activity monitor to complement EMA. The PeerMA method incorporates frequent observations from support persons in patients' daily lives, which can be compared and analyzed next to the patient's self-reports. Such data may help to study and assist patients during disease recovery, which is beneficial for patients recovering from an organ transplant.","Berrocal, A.; Concepcion, W.; Wac, K.",2025,JMIR Form Res,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ultrastructure of organelles reflects the functionality of cells, but less is understood about ultrastructural changes of hepatocytes after machine perfusion (MP) with HTK, than with UW solution. METHODS: We evaluated the ultrastructure of hepatocytes preserved in HTK solution during hypothermic (4°C) and midthermic (22°C) MP (HMP and MMP, respectively) temperatures using osmium maceration scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: The functional ultrastructure of mitochondria in hepatocytes was maintained immediately after HMP and MMP. After 2 h in a porcine isolated liver reperfusion model (IRM) that simulates transplanted liver grafts, mitochondrial cristae became denser and some large vacuoles that we assumed were autophagosomes were detected in hepatocytes after HMP. Autophagy functions in the suppression of reactive oxygen generation and subsequent apoptosis, and these findings indicated that HMP is more effective than MMP when livers are preserved in HTK solution. CONCLUSION: The present findings contradict the previous findings of the UW solution that MMP is more effective than HMP. Thus, various combinations of conditions for MP should be carefully optimized before changing preservatives.","Bochimoto, H.; Kondoh, D.; Iwata, H.; Mohd Zin, N.

290,41041903.0,10.1111/aor.70024,Biliary Glutathione as a Potential Marker for Viability Assessment of Cholangiocytes During Normothermic Machine Perfusion of Livers,"BACKGROUND: Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) is increasingly used to assess liver grafts before transplantation. While viability assessment of the hepatocellular compartment has been widely adopted, viability assessment of the biliary compartment remains controversial due to the lack of reliable markers. Glutathione (GSH) plays a key role in bile formation and may serve as a marker for biliary viability. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the suitability of GSH as a potential marker for biliary viability assessment during NMP. METHODS: Between 2018 and 2021, livers undergoing NMP were included in the study. Bile samples were collected at 1 h, 6 h, and at the end of NMP, and then analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results were correlated with perfusion parameters and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: 56 livers underwent NMP during the study period, of which 41 were successfully transplanted (73.2%). Within 1 year after transplantation, 19 patients (46.3%) developed biliary complications. 1-year patient survival was 80.5% and 1-year graft survival (death-censored) was 94.6%. The GSH in transplanted livers showed a significant increase over time (Hour 1: 25.9 ± 31.2 μM vs. End: 108.7 ± 95.3 μM, p < 0.001) and significant inverse correlation with the occurrence of biliary complications after transplantation (p < 0.05). GSH concentration at the first hour measurement was significantly lower in livers that were deemed non-transplantable (11.2 μM vs. 25.9 μM, p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Our data show an increase of GSH in bile during liver ex situ NMP. We found a negative correlation between GSH concentration and the development of biliary complications, suggesting GSH as a new marker for biliary viability assessment.","Bogensperger, C.; Esser, H.; Ponholzer, F.; Cardini, B.; Hofmann, J.; Messner, F.; Oberhuber, R.; Resch, T.; Öfner, D.; Schneeberger, S.; Weissenbacher, A.",2025,Artif Organs,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, recent modifications to HOPE research guidelines allow broader participation of cardiothoracic programs. METHODS: To quantify potential cardiothoracic HOPE donors, we used Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) data (3/2016-12/2024) to identify 101,200 donors without HIV and 273 HOPE donors (with true and false positive HIV tests). Using logistic regression, we predicted the probability of having a heart or lung(s) used for transplant among donors without HIV that had a kidney or liver used. We then applied model parameters to HOPE donors that had a kidney or liver used to estimate the number of HOPE donors that might have been cardiothoracic donors if the practice were expanded. RESULTS: Among donors without HIV, cardiothoracic donation was associated with age, cause of death, hepatitis C, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, cardiovascular disease, blood gas, and circulatory death. Applying our model, an estimated 41.0% (N = 111), 18.7% (N = 51), and 15.2% (N = 41) of HOPE donors were potential heart, any lung (single or double), or double-lung donors, as compared to 32.3%, 21.8%, and 18.2% of abdominal organ donors without HIV, respectively. This translated to an annual 13-18 potential heart and 5-8 potential lung transplants (of which 4-6 would be double-lung transplants) from HOPE donors. CONCLUSIONS: If HIV D+/R+ is more widely expanded to cardiothoracic transplantation, 41% of HOPE kidney and liver donors have the potential to donate a heart and almost 20% to donate a lung to candidates with HIV.","Bowring, M.

269,40764597.0,10.1186/s13287-025-04535-8,From signaling pathways to clinical trials: mesenchymal stem cells as multimodal regenerative architects in liver cirrhosis therapy,"Liver cirrhosis, a chronic disease distinguished by extensive scarring in the liver, results in liver dysfunction and fatal complications such as portal hypertension and liver cancer. Although early interventions can retard or reverse early injury, advanced stages often call for liver transplantation-a therapy undermined by donor shortage and logistical setbacks. Emerging cell therapies, particularly those based on mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), offer a novel approach to addressing these clinical needs. MSCs, self-renewing multipotent stromal cells, can differentiate into many cell types, including hepatocyte-like cells. Immune regulation, regenerative signaling, and anti-scarring effects are three mechanisms that underlie their therapeutic promise. MSCs modulate immune cells, suppressing inflammation and promoting tissue healing. MSCs release several growth factors and cytokines, including hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which participate in tissue regeneration. Among these, HGF is bivalent, as it supports hepatocyte proliferation while also inhibiting fibrosis and apoptosis, thereby allowing the tissue to repair and protect itself. Recent advances identify extracellular vesicles from MSCs (MSC-EVs) as a cell-free alternative. The vesicles contain bioactive cargo, including microRNAs and proteins, that regulate immune function, inhibit cell death, and facilitate liver repair. Preclinical models of cirrhosis in animals have demonstrated MSC-EVs to enhance liver function, reduce scarring, and improve survival. This review integrates current knowledge of MSC-based therapies, their mechanisms, clinical potential, and challenges associated with their deployment. More than 50 clinical trials are registered or planned to evaluate MSC-based treatments for liver cirrhosis. Preclinical and clinical outcomes are encouraging; however, further work is needed to optimize delivery strategies, confirm safety, and facilitate the universal clinical use of this approach. Advances in MSC-guided regenerative medicine have the potential to revolutionize therapy for end-stage liver disease, offering hope where traditional treatments fail.","Bozorgi, V.; Babaahmadi, M.; Salehi, M.; Vafaeimanesh, J.; Hajizadeh-Saffar, E.",2025,Stem Cell Res Ther,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, perfusion of explanted patient livers was achieved, raising the possibility of using these diseased organs to increase the fidelity and resolution of drug testing and development. Here, we provide proof-of-principle for the feasibility of this approach in the context of gene therapy. We report the first successful administration of adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (AAV8) vector treatment in the explanted liver of a 34-year-old patient with mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE), using machine perfusion. MNGIE is caused by mutations in the thymidine phosphorylase (TYMP) gene, leading to nucleoside accumulation. The patient's liver was split into anatomical left and right lobes and perfused using separate machine perfusion devices. Prior to treatment, nucleoside accumulation was observed in the perfusate of both lobes, recapitulating the cardinal feature of MNGIE. An AAV8 vector carrying the human TYMP gene was administered in the left lobe with the right serving as a control. AAV8 gene therapy resulted in successful vector uptake, with complete nucleoside clearance within 6 days of administration. Our results constitute the first demonstration of the efficacy of gene therapy for MNGIE in a human organ and provide proof-of-principle for using machine perfusion as a new strategy for disease modelling and testing novel therapeutics, e.g. gene therapy, in explanted livers.","Brevini, T.; Swift, L.; Reynolds, H.; Ong, J.; Stopforth, R.

This study aims to compare muscle injury after 24-hour acellular perfusion with static cold storage (SCS) in a porcine limb replantation model, examining outcomes for up to 7 days after reperfusion., Methods: Sixteen procured porcine forelimbs were perfused under hypothermic conditions for 24 hours with histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (n = 8) or preserved on ice for 4 hours (SCS; n = 8) before heterotopic replantation. Muscle injury was assessed using biochemical markers, and muscle biopsies were analyzed using the Histologic Injury Severity Score., Results: During preservation, limb weight decreased by 2% in the SCS group and increased by 44% in the perfusion group (P < 0.001). Twelve limbs (histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate, n = 6; SCS, n = 6) survived for 7 days.

While awareness of the disease has increased, it still remains underdiagnosed and of challenging treatment. Besides the physical toll that an HDV infection takes, the psychological impact needs to be considered when treating the infected patients. The aim of this work is to assess the psychological course of the disease from the patient's point of view and the clinicians tasked with the treatment of this specific class of patients. Two surveys covering emotional perspectives about the suspect of the disease, the diagnosis, the therapy, and the relationship between physicians and patients were administered to the clinicians and the patients. The patients reported their journey starting from sentiments of discouragement and fear upon diagnosis, the challenges associated with the disease's symptoms and the therapies, which evolved into a story of endurance, coexistence with the disease, and hope for future scientific advancements. The clinicians reported their challenges in caring for HDV-positive patients, which span from the sub-optimal referral rate, and the lack of therapeutic options to the occasional absence of patient compliance. Although, at the same time they describe elements of satisfaction that come from the efficacy of some treatments and the possibility of the development of novel drugs. In conclusion, the psychological toll that hepatitis D has on patients should be one of the factors driving communication with the physicians.","Brunetto, M.; Ciancio, A.; Coppola, N.; Santantonio, T.

Static cold storage has been the standard preservation method, but machine perfusion is emerging as a superior technique for improving graft function and posttransplant outcomes. This review addresses the role of machine perfusion in preserving pediatric and technical variant grafts with a focus on feasibility and impact on graft viability and early allograft function. RECENT FINDINGS: Clinical and experimental studies of hypothermic and normothermic machine perfusion were reviewed for pediatric and technical variant grafts. Key parameters, perfusion dynamics, biochemical markers, and outcomes were investigated and suggested that machine perfusion enhances graft quality. In addition, the feasibility and potential of liver splitting during machine perfusion along with technical considerations is being addressed. SUMMARY: Machine perfusion represents a transformative approach for pediatric and technical variant grafts, improving preservation quality and posttransplant outcomes while minimizing adverse events especially primary graft nonfunction. Currently, only normothermic machine perfusion enables viability assessment, offering a potential for expanding the donor pool. Due to the low number of pediatric liver transplantation and utilization of technical variant grafts, multicenter studies are required to define protocols and selection criteria for individual grafts, and establish machine perfusion as a standard practice in pediatric liver transplantation.","Buchholz, B.

449,,10.1097/TXD.0000000000001654,Exploring Preservation Modalities in a Split Human Pancreas Model to Investigate the Effect on the Islet Isolation Outcomes,"Background. In islet transplantation, the use of dynamic hypothermic preservation techniques is a current challenge. This study compares the efficacy of 3 pancreas preservation methods: static cold storage, hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP), and oxygenated HMP., Methods. A standardized human pancreas split model was employed using discarded organs from both donation after brain death (n = 15) and donation after circulatory death (DCD) (n = 9) donors. The pancreas head was preserved using static cold storage (control group), whereas the tail was preserved using the 3 different methods (study group). Data on donor characteristics, pancreas histology, isolation outcomes, and functional tests of isolated islets were collected., Results. Insulin secretory function evaluated by calculating stimulation indices and total amount of secreted insulin during high glucose stimulation (area under the curve) through dynamic perifusion experiments was similar across all paired groups from both DCD and donation after brain death donors. In our hands, islet yield (IEQ/g) from the pancreas tails used as study groups was higher than that of the pancreas heads as expected although this difference did not always reach statistical significance because of great variability probably due to suboptimal quality of organs released for research purposes. Moreover, islets from DCD organs had greater purity than controls (P <= 0.01) in the HMP study group. Furthermore, our investigation revealed no significant differences in pancreas histology, oxidative stress markers, and apoptosis indicators., Conclusions. For the first time, a comparative analysis was conducted, using a split model, to assess the effects of various preservation methods on islets derived from pancreas donors. Nevertheless, no discernible variances were observed in terms of islet functionality, histological attributes, or isolation efficacy.

335,40548536.0,10.6002/ect.2024.0080,Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Has the Potential to Extend Cold Ischemia Time by Reducing Inflammation and Apoptosis in Rat Livers,"OBJECTIVES: Preserving allograft function is crucial for the success of organ transplantation. Although static cold storage helps reduce organ damage, its effectiveness is limited. This study aimed to investigate the effects of early and short-term hyperbaric oxygen therapy applied to cold-stored rat liver tissues on inflammation and apoptosis and the potential to extend the tolerable cold ischemia time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected Wistar rat livers after perfusion and placed them in static cold storage alone or treated them with hyperbaric oxygen for 60 or 120 minutes immediately after placing them in cold storage. Samples were kept in cold storage for 24 hours. We evaluated histological changes by hematoxylin and eosin staining, expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin 10 by immunohistochemistry, interleukin 6 gene by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and apoptotic index by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end-labeling methods. RESULTS: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy reduced development of sinusoidal dilatation but not hydropic degeneration. This treatment also reduced the apoptotic index and expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin 10, and interleukin 6 gene (interleukin 6 mRNA). Exceptforinterleukin 6 gene expression, the decreases were more pronounced with hyperbaric oxygen therapy applied for 120 versus 60 minutes. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy partially mitigated histopathological changes in cold-stored livers and exhibited antiapoptotic and cytokine-mediated antiinflammatory effects proportional to the duration of administration. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy in addition to static cold storage, even for a limited period, may contribute to an expanded cold ischemia time and increased allograft survival.","Büyük, B.; Öztopuz, Ö; Düzenli, N.",2025,Exp Clin Transplant,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, their performance is unsatisfactory in the Spanish population, where most cDCD livers are recovered using normothermic regional perfusion (NRP). Consequently, we explored the role of different machine learning-based classifiers as predictive models for graft survival. A risk stratification score integrated with the model of end-stage liver disease score in a donor-recipient (D-R) matching system was developed. METHODS: This retrospective multicenter cohort study used 539 D-R pairs of cDCD livers recovered with NRP, including 20 donor, recipient, and NRP variables. The following machine learning-based classifiers were evaluated: logistic regression, ridge classifier, support vector classifier, multilayer perceptron, and random forest. The endpoints were the 3- and 12-mo graft survival rates. A 3- and 12-mo risk score was developed using the best model obtained. RESULTS: Logistic regression yielded the best performance at 3 mo (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.82) and 12 mo (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.83). A D-R matching system was proposed on the basis of the current model of end-stage liver disease score and cDCD-NRP risk score. CONCLUSIONS: The satisfactory performance of the proposed score within the study population suggests a significant potential to support liver allocation in cDCD-NRP grafts. External validation is challenging, but this methodology may be explored in other regions.","Calleja, R.; Rivera, M.; Guijo-Rubio, D.; Hessheimer, A.

However, specific cutoff values and therapeutic consequences vary significantly. The noninvasive (13)C-methacetin liver function breath test (LiMAx) was developed to measure the actual liver function capacity. This might also provide useful insights into graft function during NMP. METHODS: Therefore, we used an established porcine model of prolonged static cold storage (pSCS) and subsequent NMP for additional functional monitoring with the LiMAx test. Livers obtained from 9 pigs underwent NMP for 6 h directly after procurement (control group) or after 20 h of SCS (pSCS). After 6 h of NMP, the LiMAx test was performed using a liver weight-adjusted dose of (13)C-methacetin. RESULTS: After pSCS, transaminase and cholestasis parameters were found to be elevated in the perfusate and reduced lactate clearance was measured. Bile analyses further revealed reduced bile production and elevated glucose concentrations. In line with these results, the LiMAx test also showed significantly reduced values compared with the control group, with a mean value of 57.0 µg/kg/h compared with 182.0 µg/kg/h in the control group (P = 0.032). CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, we suggest the LiMAx test as a novel diagnostic tool for evaluating donor organs during NMP.","Cammann, S.; Beetz, O.; Weigle, C. A.; Tessmer, P.; Wiemann, B.; DeTemple, D.

Here we developed a CAR macrophage (CAR-M) that recognizes the major inflammatory molecule tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and activates an intracellular IL-4 signalling pathway, thereby programming engineered macrophages for an anti-inflammatory function. CAR-M therapy has exhibited efficacy in mouse models of both acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. In kidney ischaemia reperfusion injury (IRI), infused CAR-Ms switched to an anti-inflammatory phenotype in inflamed kidney and attenuated kidney IRI. The anti-inflammatory phenotype of infused CAR-Ms switched off during the recovery phase of kidney IRI, coinciding with the disappearance of TNF. In Adriamycin-induced nephropathy, a model of chronic inflammatory disease, infused CAR-Ms maintained an anti-inflammatory phenotype for several weeks in response to sustained high levels of TNF and improved kidney function and structure. CAR-Ms also effectively reduced tissue injury in another organ, the liver. Human anti-TNF CAR-Ms exhibit anti-inflammatory phenotype and function in response to TNF. The CAR-M design, using signal switching, holds promise for the treatment of a broad range of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases.","Cao, Q.; Wang, Y.; Chen, J.; Wang, R.; Chen, T.; Gloss, B.; Read, S.

This study aims to reach expert consensus on the optimal sequencing of SSTR PET and EUS biopsy in the diagnostic workup and management of patients with suspected PNETs. METHODS: A three-round modified Delphi process was used. A multidisciplinary panel of experts was recruited via snowball sampling. A set of 22 baseline statements pertaining to diagnostic workup, imaging, and biopsy was developed based on literature review and feedback obtained through a focus group. Survey rounds were conducted electronically and anonymously. A panel of international experts was asked to indicate whether they agreed, disagreed, or lacked the appropriate background to answer each statement. Of the 55 experts invited, 38 (69%) accepted to participate. Consensus was achieved with > 80% agreement. RESULTS: Response rates were 97%, 100%, and 100% in rounds 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

Warm ischemia time (WIT) and ischemia-reperfusion injury are limiting factors for vascularized composite allograft (VCA) transplantation. Subnormothermic machine perfusion (SNMP) has demonstrated the potential to extend WIT in organ transplantation. This study evaluates the effect of SNMP on VCA viability after prolonged WIT., Methods. Rat hindlimbs underwent WIT for 30, 45, 60, 120, 150, or 210 min, followed by 3-h SNMP. Monitoring of perfusion parameters and outflow determined the maximum WIT compatible with limb viability after SNMP. Thereafter, 2 groups were assessed: a control group with inbred transplantation (Txp) after 120 min of WIT and an experimental group that underwent WIT + SNMP + Txp. Graft appearance, blood gas, cytokine levels, and histology were assessed for 21 d., Results. Based on potassium levels, the limit of WIT compatible with limb viability after SNMP is 120 min. Before this limit, SNMP reduces potassium and lactate levels of WIT grafts to the same level as fresh grafts. In vivo, the control group presented 80% graft necrosis, whereas the experimental group showed no necrosis, had better healing (P = 0.0004), and reduced histological muscle injury (P = 0.012). Results of blood analysis revealed lower lactate, potassium levels, and calcium levels (P = 0.048) in the experimental group. Both groups presented an increase in interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-1b/IL-1F2 with a return to baseline after 7 to 14 d., Conclusions.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has become mainstay, however five-year survival rates remain poor, prompting the need for more treatment options. Oncolytic viruses selectively replicate in cancer cells and lyse them, representing a novel class of cancer therapeutics. We have developed a chimeric poxvirus that has enhanced oncolytic properties compared to other poxvirus strains. In this study, we evaluated the oncolytic properties of this chimeric poxvirus (HOV-2) in cholangiocarcinoma models. METHODS: Standard plaque assays and cytotoxicity assays were performed to evaluate the ability of the oncolytic virus to replicate in and kill cholangiocarcinoma cells, respectively. The KMBC human cholangiocarcinoma cell line was used to generate a xenograft model in athymic nude mice. Bilateral subcutaneous tumors were generated by injecting the cells into the lower flank areas, then the mice were administered a single dose of virus either through the intratumoral (IT) or intravenous (IV) route. RESULTS: HOV-2 effectively replicates in and kills multiple subtypes of CCA cells in a time and dose-dependent manner in vitro . In the KMBC xenograft model, both IT and IV HOV-2 treatments were found to be efficient, resulting in near complete tumor control. All animals tolerated the treatments well. CONCLUSIONS: In a human xenograft cholangiocarcinoma tumor model, HOV-2 causes significant tumor regression with minimal toxicity. These results signify HOV-2 as a safe and effective treatment in a pre-clinical model of cholangiocarcinoma.","Chen, C.; Cillis, J.; Kim, S. I.; Vashi, Y.; Yang, A.; Zhang, Z.; Park, A.

208,40694415.0,10.1681/asn.0000000826,Rationale for Targeting Complement to Mitigate Renal Transplant Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury,"Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is an unavoidable consequence of kidney transplantation and a major contributor to delayed graft function (DGF). DGF, traditionally defined as the need for dialysis within the first week post-transplant, is linked to inferior graft and patient outcomes, prolonged hospitalization, and higher health care costs. IRI begins with tissue hypoxia, which triggers an inflammatory response on reperfusion. The renal tubule plays a critical role in complement synthesis, with local activation driving inflammation and graft immunogenicity more than circulating liver-derived complement. The lectin pathway is a key initiator of complement activation in hypoxic renal tubules, primarily through collectin-11's interaction with glycan ligands on hypoxic cells, with further amplification through the alternative pathway. Despite promising preclinical results, systemic complement inhibitors have not significantly improved DGF in clinical studies, likely due to inefficient targeting of ischemic renal tubules. Machine perfusion offers a novel approach to delivering therapeutics directly to donor kidneys. Notably, hypothermic machine perfusion has improved DGF rates and early graft outcomes. Emerging targeted delivery systems using extracellular vesicles or nanoparticle-based carriers also promise to deliver therapeutics to the sites of injury. Organ-targeted complement inhibition through machine perfusion or other targeted delivery systems represent compelling strategies for IRI prevention. Finally, multigenic xenografts engineered to prevent complement activation have shown initial promise in overcoming the complement-mediated barriers that continue to challenge allotransplantation in humans.","Christou, C.

MSCs showed intact stem-core properties after liverless-NMP. Liver NMP induced specific, liver-tailored, changes in MSCs' secretome. Rat livers exposed to bioreactor-based perfusion produced more bile, released less damage and pro-inflammatory biomarkers, and showed improved mithocondrial function than those subjected to standard NMP.

68,40888693.0,10.1111/ctr.70260,Transplantation of Severely Steatotic Liver Grafts After Machine Perfusion Remains a Risky Challenge,"Liver transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with end-stage liver disease. However, donor shortages have increased the use of high-risk and extended criteria donor livers, including livers donated after circulatory death and those with severe steatosis. Severe donor liver steatosis is associated with poor outcomes due to high susceptibility to ischemia-reperfusion injury. Ex situ machine perfusion, combining hypothermic oxygenated perfusion and normothermic perfusion (termed the DHOPE-COR-NMP protocol), has emerged as a promising strategy to mitigate injury, assess liver viability, and improve transplant outcomes. Here, we present two patients who received very steatotic donor livers following resuscitation and viability assessment using DHOPE-COR-NMP. Although both steatotic donor liver functioned well during NMP and met all of our clinically validated viability criteria, the outcome after transplantation was complicated. One recipient suffered from pulmonary fat emboli syndrome, likely due to significant loss of fat from the donor liver. The second patient required retransplantation and histopathological examination of the donor liver revealed massive lipopeliosis in zones III of the explanted liver. With the increasing incidence of steatotic donor livers, further research to prevent steatosis-related posttransplant complications is becoming progressively important. At present, transplantation of severely steatotic liver grafts remains a risky challenge, even after ex situ machine perfusion.","Cirelli, R.; Thorne, A. M.; van Leeuwen, O.

Liver maximum capacity (LiMAx), using C13-methacetin, has been adopted to assist in the functional assessment of the liver before major oncological resection. We evaluated the combined use of lactate clearance and LiMAx measurement to monitor liver function during extended-duration NMP. METHODS: Seven discarded donor livers underwent extended NMP for 87-184 h using a blood-based perfusate and a modified Liver Assist device incorporating hemofiltration. Hepatocellular function was assessed every 6 h using LiMAx: a fixed bolus of C13-methacetin was administered and the delta over baseline was measured. Lactate clearance capacity was tested every 24 h by administering 50% sodium lactate to achieve perfusate concentrations of 10-15 mmol/L. RESULTS: Initial lactate clearance to <2.5 mmol/L was achieved within 1.75-7.75 h post-NMP initiation. The median LiMAx value was 829 (range, 325-3130) µg/kg/h. Livers with efficient lactate clearance (<4 h) displayed stable LiMAx profiles with consistently low, flat delta over baseline curves, maintaining similar amplitude for 80 h of perfusion, indicative of preserved hepatocyte function. Conversely, livers with progressive reductions in LiMAx amplitude and curve flattening were associated with deteriorating function and eventual graft failure. CONCLUSIONS: LiMAx enables real-time, longitudinal monitoring of hepatocyte metabolic activity during extended NMP. When combined with lactate clearance, it could offer a more comprehensive assessment of graft viability. Incorporating LiMAx into viability criteria could refine current decision-making frameworks for liver transplantation, particularly in marginal grafts.","Clarke, G.; Mao, J.; Hann, A.; Fan, Y.; Gupta, A.; Kayani, K.; Murphy, N.; Bangash, M.

In humans, ascorbate is obtained from the diet, whereas in mice, it is synthesized in the liver. In this study, we show that deletion of the Slc23a2 ascorbate transporter from hematopoietic cells depleted ascorbate to undetectable levels in HSCs and multipotent hematopoietic progenitors (MPPs) without altering the plasma ascorbate levels. Slc23a2 deficiency increased HSC reconstituting potential and self-renewal potential upon transplantation into irradiated mice. Slc23a2 deficiency also increased the reconstituting and self-renewal potentials of MPPs, conferring the ability to reconstitute irradiated mice long term. Slc23a2-deficient HSCs and MPPs divided much less frequently than control HSCs and MPPs. Increased self-renewal and reconstituting potential were observed particularly in quiescent Slc23a2-deficient HSCs and MPPs. The effect of Slc23a2 deficiency on MPP self-renewal was not mediated by reduced Tet2 function. Ascorbate thus regulates quiescence and restricts self-renewal potential in HSCs and MPPs such that ascorbate deficiency confers MPPs with long-term self-renewal potential.","Comazzetto, S.; Cassidy, D.

This therapeutic approach combines knowledge from cellular biology, tissue engineering, and translational medicine, providing new hope for treating conditions that previously lacked definitive therapeutic options. Although natural tissue regeneration occurs in some organs, such as the liver, and in superficial epidermal injuries, this process is limited. Tissue regeneration involves replacing damaged cells with cells of the same type, fully restoring tissue structure and function, while healing often results in scar tissue that may not have the same functional properties. Given this limitation, regenerative medicine aims to enhance the body's regenerative capacity. The manipulation of growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor, has been shown to increase vascularization and cell proliferation. Autologous fat grafting has emerged as a vital tool in regenerative medicine, demonstrating efficacy in promoting tissue regeneration due to its rich composition of mesenchymal stem cells and growth factors. Case studies illustrate that lipografting can improve wound healing in patients with chronic ulcers and contribute to aesthetic and functional outcomes in breast reconstruction. This study reports a case of a 27-year-old male who sustained severe trauma to his left hand in a car accident, resulting in complex injuries. Despite the potential for amputation, the decision was made to preserve the limb. A series of surgical interventions, including necrotic tissue debridement and lipografting, were conducted over several weeks, resulting in significant tissue regeneration. By the fifth week, the wound bed exhibited adequate granulation tissue, and a skin graft was applied, demonstrating successful integration and functional recovery. This case underscores the potential of regenerative medicine techniques, specifically lipografting, in limb salvage and tissue repair. Further research is needed to enhance understanding and application of these strategies in treating complex wounds and improving patient outcomes.","Contoli Isoldi, F.; Vieites, L.; Reis, A. K.

Ex vivo normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) is an organ preservation technique that enables an extended assessment of graft suitability before liver transplantation (LT). Established monitoring protocols used during NMP vary significantly in their assessment of transplant suitability when applied to the same grafts. Graft-derived cell-free DNA (gdcfDNA) analysis is an emerging tool for monitoring graft health post-transplantation. We investigated the feasibility of monitoring gdcfDNA during NMP for LT in a proof-of-concept, observational study., Methods. Serial plasma and bile samples were collected during NMP for 10 consecutive grafts, at 15 min post-machine reperfusion and then 2-h intervals. Digital polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify gdcfDNA at each time point., Results. Five grafts were suitable for LT, there were no cases of primary nonfunction or death in the recipients. gdcfDNA was quantified in all bile and plasma samples (n > 100). In plasma, gdcfDNA concentrations climbed post-machine reperfusion until 4.25 h (median 2.25 h = 15.98 x 106 copies/mL, 4.25 h = 40.21 x 106 copies/mL). gdcfDNA levels then diverged significantly when comparing the viable and non-viable graft groups (6.25 h, median viable: 117.15 x 106 copies/mL versus non-viable: 16.72 x 106 copies/mL, P = 0.01). These opposing trends correlated in each graft and in all cases with the viable/non-viable outcome. There was a trend of gradual decline in bile gdcfDNA from viable grafts post-machine reperfusion; discarded grafts showed more variable patterns of release., Conclusions. gdcfDNA analysis during NMP is a feasible and potential tool to inform viability assessment during NMP for LT.

A Systematic Review,"Machine perfusion (MP) strategies have altered the landscape of deceased donor liver procurement and preservation in recent years. Upfront costs for MP are significantly higher than those of conventional procurement/preservation techniques. We performed a systematic review to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of various MP strategies as alternatives to conventional liver procurement and preservation before liver transplantation (LT). A systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was performed for articles published up to February 2025, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Fourteen studies reported the cost-effectiveness of MP before LT, including hypothermic oxygenated liver perfusion (n = 4), normothermic machine perfusion (n = 8), and normothermic regional perfusion (n = 2). Inflation-adjusted costs per MP run varied: normothermic machine perfusion (US$11 455-35 766), hypothermic oxygenated liver perfusion (US$6489-12 686), and normothermic regional perfusion (US$9287; single study). Six studies analyzed cost-effectiveness using real-world cohorts. All but one study found MP to be cost-effective; 5 reported overall cost savings compared with conventional procurement and static cold storage. MP influenced costs across the entire LT pathway: pre-LT (lower waitlist healthcare costs, fewer procurement ""dry runs,"" improved organ utilization) and post-LT (shorter intensive care unit/hospital stays, reduced allograft dysfunction, need for dialysis, cholangiopathy, and retransplantation). Three studies found cost-effective improvements in quality-adjusted life years with MP. Although direct and indirect MP costs varied and were inconsistently reported, all studies based on real-world data found MP to be at least cost-neutral. Initial MP costs were offset by savings in waitlist and postoperative costs. Real-world data on the cost-effectiveness of NRP remain limited. Future clinical studies should include cost-effectiveness analysis to support institutional and policy-level investment in MP technologies.","Cox, D. R. A.; Ciprani, D.; Mao, J.; Dasari, B. V.

This study aimed to assess the impact of two liver graft preservation methods on fecal microbiota and changes in fecal and breath organic acids following liver transplantation. METHODS: This single-center, non-randomized prospective pilot study enrolled liver transplant patients whose grafts were preserved using either static cold storage or ex situ normothermic machine perfusion (NMP). Fresh stool and breath samples were collected immediately before surgery and at postoperative months 3, 6, and 12. Stool microbiota was profiled via 16S rRNA gene sequencing, stool short-chain fatty acids were measured using gas chromatography/-mass spectrometry, and breath volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were analyzed with selected-ion flow-tube mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Both cohorts experienced a loss of microbiota diversity and dominance by single taxa. The NMP cohort demonstrated enrichment of several beneficial gut taxa, while the static cold storage cohort showed depletion of such taxa. Various gut bacteria were found to correlate with stool short-chain fatty acids (e.g., lactic acid, butyric acid) and several VOCs. CONCLUSIONS: Fecal microbiota alterations associated with end-stage liver disease do not fully normalize to a healthy control profile following liver transplantation. However, notable differences in microbiota composition and function were observed between liver graft preservation methods. Future research with larger randomized cohorts is needed to explore whether the NMP-associated shift in gut microbiota impacts clinical outcomes and if breath VOCs could serve as biomarkers of the clinical trajectory in liver transplant patients.","Cresci, G.

Between January 2022 and March 2024, 83 DCD LTs were performed using NRP (62 NRP alone and 21 NRP + NMP) and were compared with 297 static cold storage (SCS) DCD LTs. NRP + NMP was used in scenarios with (1) long travel distances, (2) complicated transplant recipients, or (c) the need for additional liver graft recovery in ""marginal"" cases., Results. Ischemic cholangiopathy was lower in the NRP alone group (0%) and the NRP + NMP group (0%) compared with the SCS group (16.8; P < 0.001 and P = 0.04, respectively). In addition, early allograft dysfunction, number of packed red blood cells transfused, and acute kidney injury were lower in the NRP alone and NRP + NMP groups compared with the SCS group.

Recent studies have shown that the addition of the kidneys to the circuit improves the biochemical environment and could benefit liver preservation. The aim of this study was to explore the technical and anatomical feasibility of en bloc liver-pancreas-kidney MP. We also examined the safety of ex vivo perfusion with a nonoxygen carrier solution and its effects on acid-base and metabolic parameters using this novel multivisceral perfusion platform. METHODS: Five multivisceral allografts, including liver, pancreas, duodenum, and kidney, were perfused for 4 h with acellular perfusate. Hemodynamic and laboratory data were evaluated throughout the experiment. RESULTS: No system failure was reported. There were minimal changes in the acid-base parameters during the experiment. Lactate and glucose levels were stable throughout hypothermic perfusion. There was a mild increase in liver function parameters in the last hour of hypothermic perfusion. No changes in creatinine levels were observed throughout the study. The urine output increased steadily during the experiment, with an average of 155.6 mL/h. CONCLUSION: We described an innovative multivisceral MP technique that could be further used as a platform for physiological studies and targeted therapeutic interventions. Further investigations are necessary to evaluate this ex vivo perfusion technique and provide insights into the feasibility of hypothermic acellular multivisceral MP in clinical scenarios.","Cruz, R.

The aim of this follow-up study from the HOPE-ECD-DBD trial was to compare long-term outcomes in patients who underwent liver transplantation using extended criteria donor allografts from donation after brain death (ECD-DBD), randomized to either HOPE or static cold storage (SCS)., Methods: Between September 2017 and September 2020, recipients of liver transplantation from 4 European centers receiving extended criteria donor-donation after brain death allografts were randomly assigned to HOPE or SCS (1:1). Follow-up data were available for all patients. Analyzed endpoints included the incidence of late-onset complications (occurring later than 6 months and graded according to the Clavien-Dindo Classification and the Comprehensive Complication Index) and long-term graft survival and patient survival., Results: A total of 46 patients were randomized, 23 in both arms. The median follow-up was 48 months (95% CI: 41-55). After excluding early perioperative morbidity, a significant reduction in late-onset morbidity was observed in the HOPE group (median reduction of 23 Comprehensive Complication Index-points [p=0.003] and lower incidence of major complications [Clavien-Dindo >=3, 43% vs. 85%, p=0.009]). Primary graft loss occurred in 13 patients (HOPE n=3 vs. SCS n=10), resulting in a significantly lower overall graft survival (p=0.029) and adverse 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival probabilities in the SCS group, which did not reach the level of significance (HOPE 0.913, 0.869, 0.869 vs. SCS 0.783, 0.606, 0.519, respectively)., Conclusions: Our exploratory findings indicate that HOPE reduces late-onset morbidity and improves long-term graft survival providing clinical evidence to further support the broad implementation of HOPE in human liver transplantation., Copyright (C) 2024 The Authors.

This study evaluates the effectiveness of amniotic fluid (AF) compared to static cold storage and histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) solution in preserving pig livers subjected to hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion (HOMP) and ex vivo normothermic reperfusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen pig livers underwent warm ischemia for 1 h, followed by preservation under three conditions: cold storage (group 1, n = 3), HOMP with HTK (group 2, n = 3), and HOMP with AF (group 3, n = 3). Perfusion lasted 4 h, followed by 2 h of ex vivo reperfusion. Assessments included hepatic bile production, sphingomyelin levels, reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, antioxidant capacity, tissue oxygen saturation, flow dynamics, blood gas analyses, biochemical markers, and histopathological and immunohistochemical evaluations. RESULTS: AF-HOMP showed superior blood flow, lower vascular resistance, higher oxygen saturation, and better organ protection than HTK. Blood gas measurements demonstrated stable physiological levels after reperfusion. AF-HOMP improved bile production, sphingomyelin levels, glycogen preservation, and reduced parenchymal necrosis, hepatocyte vacuolization, and sinusoidal obstruction. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated protective effects on bile duct function, apoptosis, endothelial activation, and cell proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: AF-HOMP outperformed HTK in preserving liver tissue during warm ischemia, HOMP, and reperfusion. AF is a promising, cost-effective, and accessible alternative for liver preservation, potentially expanding donor pools and improving transplantation outcomes. Further research is warranted to explore its broader applications.","Dandin, O.; Yildirim, S.; Karacayli, D.; Yilmaz, C.; Ormeci, M.; Ozsipahi, A. C.; Vural, V.; Dogan, N.

This review is intended to optimize the care setting of liver transplant candidates by highlighting current indications, technical aspects and barriers with available solutions to facilitate the guidance of available strategies for healthcare professionals in specialized centres. METHODS: A review of the most recent relevant literature was conducted for all the cancer indications of liver transplantation including colorectal cancer liver metastases, hilar cholangiocarcinoma, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, neuroendocrine tumours, hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatic epitheloid haemangioendothelioma. RESULTS: Transplant benefit from the best available evidence, including SECA I, SECA II, TRANSMET studies for colorectal liver metastases, various preoperative protocols for cholangiocarcinoma patients, standard, extended selection criteria for hepatocellular carcinoma and neuroendocrine tumours, are discussed. Innovative approaches to deal with organ shortages, including machine-perfused deceased grafts, living donor liver transplantation and RAPID procedures, are also explored. CONCLUSION: Cancer indications for liver transplantation are here to stay, and the selection criteria among all cancer groups are likely to evolve further with improved prognostication of tumour biology using adjuncts such as radiomics, cancer genomics, and circulating DNA and RNA status. International prospective registry-based studies could overcome the limitations of smaller patient cohorts and lack of level 1 evidence.","Dasari, B. V. M.; Line, P.

377,,10.1097/TP.0000000000004872,Challenges With the Implementation of Machine Perfusion in Clinical Liver Transplantation,"Dynamic organ preservation is a relatively old technique which has regained significant interest in the last decade. Machine perfusion (MP) techniques are applied in various fields of solid organ transplantation today. The first clinical series of ex situ MP in liver transplantation was presented in 2010. Since then, the number of research and clinical applications has substantially increased. Despite the notable beneficial effect on organ quality and recipient outcome, MP is still not routinely used in liver transplantation. Based on the enormous need to better preserve organs and the subsequent demand to continuously innovate and develop perfusion equipment further, this technology is also beneficial to test and deliver future therapeutic strategies to livers before implantation. This article summarizes the various challenges observed during the current shift from static to dynamic liver preservation in the clinical setting. The different organ perfusion strategies are discussed first, together with ongoing clinical trials and future study design. The current status of research and the impact of costs and regulations is highlighted next. Factors contributing to costs and other required resources for a worldwide successful implementation and reimbursement are presented third. The impact of research on cost-utility and effectivity to guide the tailored decision-making regarding the optimal perfusion strategy is discussed next.

71,39557163.0,10.1016/j.jhep.2024.11.013,Mastering the narrative: Precision reporting of risk and outcomes in liver transplantation,"Liver transplantation is associated with a high risk of postoperative complications due to the complexity of the surgical procedure, recipient disease severity and the wide range of graft quality, which remains somewhat unpredictable. However, survival rates after transplantation continue to improve and the focus has thus turned to other clinically relevant endpoints including post-transplant complications, patient quality of life and costs. Procedures like liver transplantation offer the entire spectrum of post-surgical events, even in donor-recipient constellations deemed of low risk within recently defined benchmark criteria. The Clavien-Dindo classification and the CCI (comprehensive complication index) were established to assess postoperative morbidity and are widely utilised across surgical specialties. These scores depend on the number and grade of complications, which reflect the interventions required, and are frequently used to assess specific donor-recipient risk profiles and new approaches, such as machine perfusion. However, these scores are associated with inter-observer variability when used in practice, mainly due to the lack of uniform definitions. The concept of benchmarking was recently introduced in surgery and transplantation as a mechanism of standardising expected donor/recipient risk with outcomes within the first year after surgery. However, the management of complications differs significantly worldwide, as does the rating scale assigned to various complications. This may lead to inhomogeneous interpretation of study results, leading to difficulty in assessing the clinical effects of novel preservation technologies and other therapeutics in liver transplantation. This article critically discusses frequent challenges associated with risk and outcome assessment following liver transplantation.","de Goeij, F. H. C.; Wehrle, C.

36,41083170.0,10.51821/88.3.14297,Dynamic liver preservation: current evidence and future challenges,"BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Liver transplantation (LT) is limited by organ shortage. Dynamic preservation (DP) techniques have rapidly become the standard of care in liver graft preservation, particularly for extended criteria donors (ECD). This study reviews the clinical applications and future potential of various DP techniques in LT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A literature review was conducted using Medline (PubMed) to identify relevant studies on DP techniques, including normothermic machine perfusion (NMP), hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE), and normothermic regional perfusion (NRP). RESULTS: A growing number of high-impact studies support the clinical implementation of MP techniques. NMP maintains the organ metabolically active, enabling real-time graft viability assessment through markers of function and injury. When initiated at the donor hospital, NMP helps reduce or even eliminate ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). HOPE, on the other hand, mitigates IRI by supporting mitochondrial recovery, with flavin mononucleotide serving as a reliable surrogate marker of graft function. Importantly, both NMP and HOPE allow for safely extended preservation times, improving LT logistics and avoiding the need for nighttime procedures. NRP restores oxygenated blood flow in donation after circulatory death donors, reducing biliary complications and improving graft outcomes compared to rapid organ recovery. Emerging strategies, such as controlled oxygenated rewarming, combine HOPE and NMP to sequentially optimize graft preservation and assessment. CONCLUSIONS: DP has revolutionized liver preservation, providing superior outcomes compared to static cold storage, particularly for ECD. Clarity and consensus are needed regarding the definition of clinically relevant endpoints to broaden the applicability of study results on DP.","De Stefano, N.; Monbaliu, D.; Blondeel, J.",2025,Acta Gastroenterol Belg,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This study compared the outcomes of controlled DCD LT with normothermic regional perfusion and subsequent ex situ machine perfusion to those of DBD LT with static cold storage and extended criteria DBD (ECD) LT with dual hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (DHOPE), selected by propensity score matching. RESULTS: Three comparable cohorts were selected from transplants performed between January 2016 and June 2024: 61 DCD (DHOPE, n = 50; normothermic machine perfusion, n = 11), 122 DBD-static cold storage, and 122 ECD-DHOPE. Median functional warm ischemia time in DCD donors was 44 (39-48) min. Livers were assessed and accepted for LT based on normothermic regional perfusion parameters. All considered outcomes were comparable between groups and in line with benchmark values. One-year graft and patient survival exceeded 90% in all groups, whereas 3-y graft survival was 91.8%, 93.4%, and 88% in the DCD, DBD-static cold storage, and ECD-DHOPE groups, respectively.

However, emerging evidence indicates that highly selected patients with unresectable CRLM can achieve long-term survival following LT-often with outcomes superior to those obtained through conventional systemic therapies. To evaluate the evolving role of LT in this setting, we conducted a scoping review of the literature. A comprehensive search was performed across PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov, as well as ProQuest Dissertations & Theses and Google Scholar to capture gray literature. The search included English-language articles published between January 2015 and April 2025. Eligible studies included those reporting on the application of LT for patients with unresectable CRLM. This scoping review synthesizes current evidence on patient selection criteria, overall and disease-free survival, recurrence patterns, and emerging biomarkers that may guide transplant eligibility. In addition, we explore innovations in organ utilization-including living donor LT and machine perfusion technologies-that aim to expand access while addressing ethical concerns related to organ allocation. As LT for CRLM transitions from investigational use to clinical implementation, this review outlines the key challenges and future opportunities that will shape its role in the landscape of transplant oncology.","Demirors, B.; Sethi, V.; Abdullah, A.; Elias, C.; Spitz, F.; Mial-Anthony, J.; Packiaraj, G.; Subedi, S.; Han, S.; Fokken, T.; Molinari, M.",2025,Curr Oncol,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the relations between donor factors and these criteria are poorly understood. The aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate the association between donor-related risk factors and the decision to transplant a liver subjected to NMP. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed for articles published up to March 2025 in four databases, reporting livers subjected to NMP for viability assessment prior to transplantation. Effect size (ES) was calculated using Cohen's D and log odds ratio. RESULTS: Out of 806 unique articles, 18 were included in this meta-analysis, encompassing 690 liver grafts that underwent NMP. Following viability assessment during NMP, utilisation rate was 82% from donors after brain death and 68% from donors after circulatory death (ES: 0.08, p = 0.88). Transplanted livers had shorter cold ischemia time (ES: -0.34, p = 0.003) and lower liver weight (ES: -0.53, p < 0.001). Donor age, BMI and donor warm ischemia time did not differentiate between transplanted and unused groups. Differences were observed in viability assessment for lactate clearance (ES: 2.0, p = 0.005), glucose metabolism (ES: 2.2, p < 0.001), bile production (ES: 1.0, p = 0.003) and pH (ES: 1.9, p < 0.001). Excellent outcomes, including 10% non-anastomotic strictures, 89% graft survival and 93% patient survival, were achieved in a large cohort of high-risk livers. CONCLUSION: Cold ischemia time and liver weight were identified as donor-related risk factors, whereas donor type, age and donor warm ischemia time appear not to impact the decision to transplant during NMP.","den Dekker, A.

METHODS: We queried the UNOS database from 2018 to 2024 to analyze patients undergoing adult liver retransplantation alone. Logistic regression analyses were conducted for early graft loss (EGL), perioperative mortality at 30 and 90 days, and 1-year mortality. RESULTS: We identified 1754 liver retransplants of which 100 were performed using machine perfusion. Median recipient age in the machine perfusion group was 54.0. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated 79.0% decrease in 30-day EGL (p=0.02 OR 0.211) with improved 30- and 90-day mortality by 77.0% and 66.0% respectively (p=0.03, OR 0.233, p=0.03, OR 0.343). SCS was associated with 69% increased risk of 1-year mortality (p=0.01, OR, 0.306).

While beneficial effects on patient outcomes were demonstrated, biomarkers for viability assessment during HOPE are scarce and lack validation. This study aims to validate the predictive potential of perfusate flavin mononucleotide (FMN) during HOPE to enable the implementation of FMN-based assessment into clinical routine and to identify safe organ acceptance thresholds. FMN was measured in perfusate samples of 50 liver grafts at multiple time points. After transplantation, patients were followed up for development of early allograft dysfunction (EAD), transplantation, and 1-year survival. FMN concentrations were significantly higher for grafts that developed EAD at 5 and 60 minutes into HOPE ( p = 0.008, p = 0.026). The strongest predictive potential of FMN for EAD was observed at 5 minutes of HOPE with an AUC of 0.744. Similarly, 5-minute FMN was predictive for 1-year mortality ( p < 0.001), reaching a remarkable AUC of 0.890. Cutoffs for prediction of EAD (10.6 ng/mL) and early mortality (23.5 ng/mL) were determined and allowed risk stratification of grafts. Particularly, patients receiving low-risk grafts developed EAD in 9% of cases, while all patients survived the first postoperative year. In contrast, high-risk organs developed an incidence of EAD at 62%, accompanied by the necessity of retransplantation in 38% of cases. One-year mortality in the high-risk cohort was 62%. Evaluation of FMN as early as 5 minutes during HOPE allows for risk stratification of liver grafts. Low-risk grafts, according to FMN, display a negligible risk for patients. Yet, high-risk grafts are associated with increased risk for EAD, transplantation, and early mortality and should not be used for transplantation without further assessment.","Dingfelder, J.; Kollmann, D.; Rauter, L.; Pereyra, D.; Kacar, S.; Weijler, A.

However, few studies have examined the association of prognostic communication with symptoms, mood, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in this population. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study of 218 outpatients with DC, we assessed their self-reported health status (terminally ill vs not terminally ill), their prognostic communication with their hepatologists (Prognosis and Treatment Preferences Questionnaire), symptom burden (Revised Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale), psychological distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and HRQOL (Short-Form Liver Disease Quality of Life scale). We used linear regression to examine associations among patients' self-reported health status and prognostic communication with their symptom burden, psychological distress, and HRQOL. RESULTS: Over 75% of patients reported that prognostic communication was helpful for making treatment decisions, maintaining hope, and coping with their disease. However, 81% had never discussed their end-of-life care wishes with their hepatologists. Overall, 36% self-reported a terminally ill health status, which was associated with higher symptom burden (B = 8.33; P = .003), anxiety (B = 1.97; P = .001), and depression (B = 2.01; P = .001) and lower HRQOL (B = -7.22; P = .002). Patients who wished they had more information on their prognosis reported higher symptom burden (B = 7.14; P = .010), anxiety (B = 1.63; P = .005), and depression (B = 1.50; P = .010) and lower HRQOL (B = -7.65; P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: Although most patients with DC highly valued prognostic communication, the majority reported never discussing their end-of-life care preferences with their hepatologists. Self-reported terminally ill health status and inadequate prognostic communication were associated with poorer symptoms, mood, and HRQOL.

Nonetheless, it introduces unique anesthetic challenges, including extended pneumoperitoneum, restricted patient access, and a risk of undetected blood loss. This article describes an anesthetic approach and patient outcomes for the first four total robotic liver transplants performed at a tertiary university hospital in Portugal, along with inaugural procedures of their kind in Europe. We retrospectively analyzed surgical and anesthetic data from four patients who underwent total robotic liver transplantation from February to April 2024. Data encompassed clinical profile, preoperative assessment, surgical and anesthesia details, postoperative course, and outcomes. Patients' age ranged from 51 to 69 years. Their cirrhosis was primarily due to alcohol use, hepatitis C virus infection, hepatocellular carcinoma, or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. General anesthesia was administered. Hemodynamic monitoring and goal-directed fluid therapy were conducted using a PiCCO system. Blood loss varied from 1,000 to 5,000 mL. Blood products were transfused as needed. All donor livers underwent hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion before transplantation. After surgery, two patients were immediately extubated, while two required extended ventilation. Hospital stays ranged from 10 to 40 days. The 30-day survival rate was 100%. This initial case series affirmed the feasibility and safety of total robotic liver transplantation for carefully selected patients, yielding favorable short-term results. Anesthetic management can rely on proactive strategies, acute situational awareness, and effective multidisciplinary collaboration.","Duarte, A.; Katerenchuk, V.; Poeira, R.; Rocha, P.; Pissarra, F.; Canas, M.; Dias, S.; Andrade, D.; Marques, H.

While pregnancy outcomes are overall favorable, these pregnancies are at higher risk and warrant careful planning and immunosuppression management. Transplant recipients value receiving reproductive health counseling from their transplant team; thus, provider knowledge surrounding pre-conception through postpartum management is key to optimizing obstetric and graft outcomes. A critical role of transplant providers lies in reproductive counseling to ascertain whether patients are sexually active, whether they hope to avoid pregnancy, and/or desire future pregnancy planning. This review, therefore, highlights the key clinical considerations with practical guidance for counseling and management of reproductive health in LT recipients.","Dukewich, M.; Coscia, L.; Afshar, Y.; Sarkar, M.",2025,Liver Transpl,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to assess long-term outcomes after transplantation of hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion (HOPE)-treated donor livers based on real-world data (i.e., IDEAL-D stage 4). METHODS: In this international, multicentre, observational cohort study, we collected data from adult recipients of HOPE-treated livers transplanted between January 2012 and December 2021. Analyses were stratified by donation after brain death (DBD) and donation after circulatory death (DCD), sub-divided by their respective risk categories. The primary outcome was death-censored graft survival. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of primary non-function (PNF) and ischaemic cholangiopathy (IC). RESULTS: We report on 1,202 liver transplantations (64% DBD) performed at 22 European centres. For DBD, a total number of 99 benchmark (8%), 176 standard (15%), and 493 extended-criteria (41%) cases were included. For DCD, 117 transplants were classified as low risk (10%), 186 as high risk (16%), and 131 as futile (11%), with significant risk profile variations among centres. Actuarial 1-, 3-, and 5-year death-censored graft survival rates for DBD and DCD livers were 95%, 92%, and 91%, vs. 92%, 87%, and 81%, respectively (log-rank p = 0.003). Within DBD and DCD strata, death-censored graft survival was similar among risk groups (log-rank p = 0.26, p = 0.99). Graft loss due to PNF or IC was 2.3% and 0.4% (DBD), and 5% and 4.1% (DCD). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows excellent 5-year survival after transplantation of HOPE-treated DBD and DCD livers with low rates of graft loss due to PNF or IC, irrespective of their individual risk profile.

BACKGROUND: Organ shortage has led to increased use of elderly donor livers for an ageing group of recipients, particularly in Europe. We hypothesized that hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE) enhances graft resilience against aging in livers from elderly donors. METHODS: This post hoc analysis of the multicenter European HOPE-REAL study (NCT05520320) examined liver age in adult recipients of HOPE-treated brain-dead donor (DBD) livers. Cumulative liver age was defined as the sum of donor age and post-transplant graft survival. HOPE-treated DBD liver transplants were compared with a single-center control cohort of non-perfused DBD livers using propensity score matching to adjust for confounders. RESULTS: The median cumulative liver age was significantly higher in the HOPE-treated (n=768) cohort than in the non-perfused (n=863) group (69 vs 61 years, P <0.001), yet graft survival was superior in the HOPE-treated group (log-rank P <0.001). After matching, cumulative liver age remained significantly higher in the HOPE group ( P <0.001). Multivariate analysis identified HOPE as an independent predictor of cumulative liver age ( P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: HOPE treatment seems to mitigate the risks associated with transplanting elderly DBD livers, leading to excellent long-term survival in an ageing recipient population. These findings support broader adoption of HOPE to improve utilization of older donor livers and expand the donor pool.","Eden, J.; Müller, P. C.; Kuemmerli, C.; Aegerter, N.; Brüggenwirth, I. M.

We therefore intended to test, in an international liver transplant cohort, recently described mitochondrial injury biomarkers measured during HOPE before liver transplantation. METHODS: Perfusate samples of human livers from ten centers in seven countries with HOPE experience were analyzed for released mitochondrial compounds, i.e. flavin mononucleotide (FMN), NADH, purine derivatives and inflammatory markers. Livers deemed unsuitable for transplantation served as negative controls. RESULTS: We collected 473 perfusate samples of human donation after cardiac death (n = 315) and donation after brain death (n = 158) livers. Fluorometric assessment of FMN in perfusate was validated by mass spectrometry (R = 0.7011, p <0.0001). Graft loss due to primary non-function or cholangiopathy was predicted by perfusate FMN values (c-statistic mass spectrometry 0.8418, 95% CI 0.7466-0.9370, p <0.0001; c-statistic fluorometry 0.7733, 95% CI 0.7006-0.8461, p <0.0001). Perfusate FMN values were also significantly correlated with symptomatic non-anastomotic strictures and kidney failure, and superior for the prediction of graft loss than conventional scores derived from donor and recipient parameters, such as the donor risk index and the balance of risk score. Mitochondrial FMN values in liver tissues of non-utilized livers were low, and inversely correlated to high perfusate FMN values and purine metabolite release. CONCLUSIONS: This first international study validates the predictive value of the mitochondrial cofactor FMN, released from complex I during HOPE, and may therefore contribute to a better risk stratification of injured livers before implantation. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: Analysis of 473 perfusates, collected from ten international centers during HOPE (hypothermic oxygenated perfusion), revealed that mitochondria-derived flavin mononucleotide values in perfusate are predictive of graft loss, cholangiopathy, and kidney failure after liver transplantation. This result is of high clinical relevance, as recognition of graft quality is urgently needed to improve the safe utilization of marginal livers. Ex situ machine perfusion approaches, such as HOPE, are therefore likely to increase the number of useable liver grafts.","Eden, J.; Thorne, A. M.; Bodewes, S.

Up to now, there is no case report in the literature describing HSI for quality assessment of a machine perfused donor liver. The allocated liver from a 49-year-old female donor (161 cm, 70 kg) was perfused with the OrganOx(®) normothermic machine perfusion system in the recommended way. Organ quality assessment was performed based on laboratory values at defined time points. In addition, the final evaluation of the liver comprised macroscopic findings and HSI of each liver segment. After discarding the organ, biopsies were taken from each segment and correlated with the results of the HSI. CASE SUMMARY: The donor liver's size (29 cm × 17 cm × 11 cm) and weight of 2180 g posed challenges for adequate placement within the organ container. Baseline biopsy of the liver revealed no evidence of fibrosis, steatosis or inflammation. An hour after perfusion start, measurements of the perfusate indicated a pH of 7.18, a glucose level of 404 mg/dL, and a lactate level of 1.7 mmol/L. Throughout perfusion, a significant decline in glucose levels began at the fourth hour, reaching a nadir of 20 mg/dL after eight hours. Concurrently, lactate levels steadily rose, peaking at 4.9 mmol/L after the total perfusion time of 12 hours. Macroscopic alterations (signs of congestion and reduced blood circulation) on the liver's surface were noted, particularly pronounced in segments 2, 3, and 8. HSI of these areas unveiled significant reduced oxygenation. Consequently, based on all these observations, the decision was made to discard the organ. Histological examination of the altered regions revealed congestion, necrotic changes, and dissociation of sinusoidal lining cells from liver cell cords. The histological findings correlated well with the HSI. CONCLUSION: This case report describes the integration of HSI in the decision making of the decline of a 49-year-old machine perfused donor liver. HSI offered useful information concerning the tissue morphology and graft viability and could therefore be a useful additional tool in assessing donor liver quality before transplantation.","El-Mahrouk, M.; Langner, C.; Sucher, R.; Kniepeiss, D.",2025,World J Transplant,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

401,,10.1097/MOT.0000000000001224,New methods for improving pancreas preservation,"Purpose of review: Pancreas and islet transplantation face critical organ shortage challenges, with many potential grafts discarded due to concerns about consequences of ischemia-reperfusion injury, particularly from donation after circulatory death (DCD) donors. Static cold storage remains standard practice but has significant limitations. Novel preservation technologies may improve transplant outcomes, donor selection and even expand the donor pool., Recent findings: Normothermic regional perfusion in DCD donors has increased pancreas utilization with promising one-year graft survival comparable to donation after brain-death (DBD) donors. Hypothermic machine perfusion maintains tissue integrity and shows promising preclinical results. Oxygenated hypothermic machine perfusion successfully restores tissue adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels without notable tissue injury. Normothermic machine perfusion, despite challenges, offers potential for viability assessment and resuscitation., Summary: Advanced preservation technologies provide platforms for assessment, reconditioning, and therapeutic interventions for pancreas grafts. Clinical translation requires consensus on perfusion parameters and perfusate composition optimized for pancreatic preservation. Future developments should focus on implementing sensitive and specific assessment methods, including beta-cell specific biomarkers, to confidently select and utilize marginal pancreas grafts for transplantation., Copyright (C) 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

However, developing new cryopreservation protocols requires exploration of a complex design space, further complicated by the scarcity of real human livers to experiment upon. We aim to create computational models of the liver to aid in the development of new cryopreservation protocols. Towards this goal, we present an approach for generating 3D models of the liver vasculature by building upon the space colonization algorithm. Additionally, we introduce the concept of a super lobule which enables a computational abstraction of biological liver lobules. User-tunable parameters allow for vasculatures of varying depth and topology to be generated. In each model, we solve for a common lumped resistance value assigned to the super lobules, allowing the overall physiological blood pressure and flow rate through the liver to be preserved. We demonstrate our approach's ability to maintain consistency between models of varying depth. Finally, we simulate steady state machine perfusion of the generated models and demonstrate how they can be used to quickly test the effect of different boundary conditions when designing organ preservation protocols.","Emerson, D.; Rabin, Y.; Kara, L.

The effect of arterial reconstruction on the deve-lopment of primary ischemic cholangiopathy has not been fully elucidated in liver transplants with organs donated after circulatory death. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of normothermic machine perfusion with arterial reconstruction at the onset of ischemic cholangiopathy in liver transplants with organs donated after circulatory death. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 93 patients who had received liver transplants donated after circulatory death for the period from 2015 to 2023 at a single institution. The primary endpoint was the onset of primary ischemic cholangiopathy within 1 year after donation after circulatory death liver transplant, excluding secondary ischemic cholangiopathy due to arterial complications. RESULTS: Normothermic machine perfusion was used for 71 cases, whereas standard cold storage was applied for 22 cases. Arterial reconstruction was performed in 14.1% of cases versus 27.3% of cases without normothermic machine perfusion. The cumulative onset of ischemic cholangiopathy was 7.0% versus 27.2% without normothermic machine perfusion (P = .013). In the group with normothermic machine perfusion, competing risk analyses demonstrated that the cumulative ischemic cholangiopathy onset rate was significantly higher in the group with arterial reconstruction (30.0%) versus without arterial reconstruction (3.3%) (P < .003). Total cold ischemia time and cold ischemia time between liver recovery and normothermic machine perfusion initiation were significantly longer in the group with arterial reconstruction (P < .001), without significant differences in arterial flow on normothermic machine perfusion and other relevant factors. CONCLUSIONS: In donation after circulatory death liver transplant recipients with normothermic machine perfusion, arterial reconstruction is a risk factor for developing ischemic cholangiopathy, likely mediated by cold ischemia time prolongation.","Emily, J.; Tomosugi, T.; Longchamp, A.; Teo, R.; Kimura, S.; Montgomery, J.; Burdine, L.; Markmann, J.; Yeh, H.; Nakamura, T.",2025,Exp Clin Transplant,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ex situ machine perfusion is increasingly used to preserve and assess donor livers before transplantation. Compared with traditional static cold storage (SCS), machine perfusion exposes livers to an additional risk of microbial contamination. However, information on the risk of microbial transmission during machine perfusion is lacking., Methods. All livers that underwent either hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion (HOPE) or normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) in our center between September 2021 and September 2023, and during which samples were taken from SCS fluid and/or machine perfusion solution for microbiological examination, were included in this retrospective, observational clinical study. Microbial transmission was examined from SCS fluid to machine perfusion solution fluid and, subsequently, to recipients of these livers., Results. A total of 90 cases of liver machine perfusion were included: 59 HOPE and 31 NMP. SCS preservation fluid cultures before HOPE or NMP were positive for at least 1 microorganism in 52% of the cases. After HOPE, there were no cases of positive machine perfusion fluid or evidence of microbial transmission to the recipients. After NMP, in 1 (3%) patient Escherichia coli was grown from abdominal drain fluid, the same bacterial strain that was also grown from the SCS preservation fluid before NMP. This E coli was resistant to the antibiotics that are routinely added to the NMP perfusion fluid., Conclusions. The risk of microbial transmission after machine perfusion is very low but not absent. We recommend routine sampling of machine perfusion fluid at the end of the procedure for microbiological analysis., (C) 2024 The Authors.

Although DHOPE reduces ischemia/reperfusion-related complications after liver transplantation, data on cost-effectiveness are lacking. Our objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of DHOPE in donation after circulatory death (DCD) liver transplantation., Methods. We performed an economic evaluation of DHOPE versus static cold storage (SCS) based on a multicenter randomized controlled trial in DCD liver transplantation (DHOPE-DCD trial; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02584283). All patients enrolled in the 3 participating centers in the Netherlands were included. Costs related to the transplant procedure, hospital stay, readmissions, and outpatients treatments up to 1 y posttransplant were calculated. The cost for machine perfusion was calculated using 3 scenarios: (1) costs for machine perfusion, (2) machine perfusion costs plus costs for personnel, and (3) scenario 2 plus depreciation expenses for a dedicated organ perfusion room., Results. Of 119 patients, 60 received a liver after DHOPE and 59 received a liver after SCS alone. The mean total cost per patient up to 1 y posttransplant was [Euro sign]126 221 for the SCS group and [Euro sign]110 794 for the DHOPE group.

Utilizing marginal livers necessitates distinguishing between injured but recoverable livers and those that are irreversibly damaged. Bile duct injury, prevalent in these grafts, poses significant risks, as ischemic injuries can be challenging to assess and may lead to recipient bile duct strictures and ultimately graft failure. This study aimed to identify objective measurements that enhance existing viability criteria and facilitate the diagnosis of ischemic injuries. We employed ex situ machine perfusion (MP) to monitor porcine livers subjected to standardized biliary injury (BileINJ), standardized global liver injury (GlobalINJ), and no injury (CTRL) (n=23). Using microdialysis catheters and pCO2 sensors, we analyzed liver tissue, hilar plate, and bile duct, in addition to standard viability assessments, collecting data on 77 variables. Principal component analysis indicated distinct clustering of the GlobalINJ and partially the BileINJ group away from the CTRL group during MP. Feature extraction models highlighted microdialysate lactate, lactate/pyruvate ratio, glycerol, tissue pCO2, and blood gas hematocrit as critical indicators for classifying liver state. Histopathological evaluations confirmed group-specific liver and bile injuries. We identified unique metabolic patterns that differentiate ischemic injured from non-injured porcine livers and were able to distinguish liver and biliary injury. Real-time monitoring of livers using microdialysis and tissue pCO2 during MP is feasible and clinically available. Measurements taken in the hilar plate show the ability to identify bile duct damage while not introducing measurement devices to the vulnerable bile duct itself. Our findings enable more objective and timely selection of transplantable livers and warrant further investigation in clinical studies.","Færden, I. H.; Bliksøen, M. M.; Liavåg, O.

Although globally rare, it accounts for a large proportion of liver cancer in children and has poor survival rates in high-risk and metastatic cases. This review discusses the molecular mechanisms, diagnostic methods, and therapeutic strategies of HB. Mutations in the CTNNB1 gene and the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway are essential genetic factors. Furthermore, genetic syndromes like Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) and Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) considerably heighten the risk of associated conditions. Additionally, epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and the influence of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), are pivotal drivers of tumor development. Diagnostics include serum biomarkers, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and imaging techniques. Standard treatments are chemotherapy, surgical resection, and liver transplantation (LT). Emerging therapies like immunotherapy and targeted treatments offer hope against chemotherapy resistance. Future research will prioritize personalized medicine, novel biomarkers, and molecular-targeted therapies to improve survival outcomes.","Fan, L.; Na, J.; Shi, T.; Liao, Y.",2025,Curr Oncol,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we developed and validated a novel machine perfusion approach for mitigating risk factors and salvaging severe DCD livers. METHODS: A novel hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE) system was developed, incorporating two pumps and an elastic water sac to emulate the functionality of the cardiac cycle. Compared to conventional systems (HOPE S1 and S2), the novel HOPE system (HOPE S3) was evaluated in rats, utilizing healthy livers perfused with methylene blue diluted using Histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) solution or DCD livers subjected to 60 min of warm ischemia without heparin administration. Liver perfusion outcomes were assessed through macroscopic and microscopic evaluations, molecular analyses, and orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). RESULTS: DCD livers subjected to HOPE systems' perfusion exhibited decreased injury and enhanced survival rates compared to static cold storage following 60 min of warm ischemia (DCD + SCS). The 4-week post-transplantation survival rates were 0%, 20%, and 33% in the DCD + SCS, HOPE S1, and HOPE S2 groups, respectively. HOPE S3 conferred protection against hepatocyte and non-parenchymal cell injury, resulting in a 67% animal survival rate following 60 min of warm donor ischemia (HOPE S3). Assessments of hepatic sinusoidal microcirculation, morphological changes, and molecular alterations in preserved livers further confirmed these findings. CONCLUSIONS: The newly devised machine perfusion system can enhance and uniform liver perfusion and may become a promising tool for revitalizing DCD liver grafts afflicted with severe warm ischemic injuries.","Fan, L.; Xia, H.; Peng, G.; Wang, W.; Fu, Z.; Ye, Q.",2025,Artif Organs,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
378,,10.1097/HEP.0000000000000873,The future of liver transplantation,"Over the last 50 years, liver transplantation has evolved into a procedure routinely performed in many countries worldwide. Those able to access this therapy frequently experience a miraculous risk-benefit ratio, particularly if they face the imminently life-threatening disease. Over the decades, the success of liver transplantation, with dramatic improvements in early posttransplant survival, has aggressively driven demand. However, despite the emergence of living donors to augment deceased donors as a source of organs, supply has lagged far behind demand. As a result, rationing has been an unfortunate focus in recent decades. Recent shifts in the epidemiology of liver disease combined with transformative innovations in liver preservation suggest that the underlying premise of organ shortage may erode in the foreseeable future. The focus will sharpen on improving equitable access while mitigating constraints related to workforce training, infrastructure for organ recovery and rehabilitation, and their associated costs. Research efforts in liver preservation will undoubtedly blossom with the aim of optimizing both the timing and conditions of transplantation. Coupled with advances in genetic engineering, regenerative biology, and cellular therapies, the portfolio of innovation, both broad and deep, offers the promise that, in the future, liver transplantation will not only be broadly available to those in need but also represent a highly durable life-saving therapy., Copyright (C) 2024 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.","Feng, S.; Roll, G.; Rouhani, F.; Sanchez Fueyo, A.",2024,Hepatology,EMBASE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The persistent imbalance between organ availability and the number of patients on the waiting list presents both ethical and medical challenges in everyday clinical practice. Expanding the donor pool-and consequently increasing the number of retrieved grafts-requires action on multiple levels. These include raising awareness about organ donation, promoting willingness to donate, and increasing knowledge of post-transplant outcomes among the general population and healthcare professionals. In addition, organ acceptance criteria should be refined by incorporating recent advances in transplant hepatology and surgery. The survival benefit achieved through liver transplantation is well established for many conditions. To further improve long-term outcomes, more tailored and refined surveillance protocols are needed for the metabolic and neoplastic comorbidities that commonly develop after transplantation. In this updated literature review, we aim to highlight the main advances in these two crucial areas of liver transplantation.","Ferrarese, A.; Battistella, S.; D'Arcangelo, F.; Feltrin, G.; Barbieri, S.; Bassi, D.; Zanetto, A.; Germani, G.; Russo, F.

Ex vivo genetic modification of grafts using machine perfusion presents a promising approach to improve graft function and modulate immune responses while minimizing risks of off-target effects and systemic immunogenicity in vivo. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of using normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) to mimic in vitro conditions for effective gene delivery. In this study, lentiviral vectors encoding the secreted biomarker Gaussia Luciferase (GLuc) and red fluorescent protein (RFP) were introduced ex vivo to rodent livers during a 72-h machine perfusion protocol. After an initial 24-h exposure to viral vectors, the organs were maintained in perfusion for an additional 48 h to monitor gene expression, aligning with in vitro benchmarks. Control livers were perfused in similar fashion, but without viral injections. Virally perfused livers exhibited nearly a 10-fold increase in luminescence compared to controls (p < 0.0001), indicating successful genetic modification of the organs. These findings validate the use of machine perfusion systems and viral vectors to genetically engineer whole organs ex vivo, laying the groundwork for a broad range of applications in transplantation through genetic manipulation of organ systems. Future studies will focus on refining this technology to enhance precision in gene expression and explore its implications for clinical translation.","Filz von Reiterdank, I.; Mojoudi, M.; Bento, R.; Taggart, M.

311,41039720.0,10.1111/petr.70198,Utilization of a Pediatric DCD Liver Following Normothermic Regional Perfusion: A Case Report on the Youngest Donor in the United States,"BACKGROUND: Normothermic regional perfusion (NRP) is gaining rapid popularity in adult donation after circulatory death (DCD) to increase organ utilization and improve outcomes. However, literature is lacking for the pediatric population. We therefore present the youngest DCD donor in the United States from whom a liver was recovered with NRP and subsequently transplanted. METHODS: The donor was a 5-year-old male who underwent thoraco-abdominal NRP for kidney and liver procurement. In total, 72 min passed from the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment to the start of NRP, resulting in 10 min of functional warm ischemia time. The donor was perfused for 80 min, with lactate levels decreasing from 8.29 at the start of perfusion to 5.40 mmol/L at the end of perfusion. The procured graft weighed 480 g and was subsequently transplanted in an adult female recipient with decompensated cirrhosis due to alcohol-associated liver disease. RESULTS: The liver was successfully utilized and functioned immediately with no graft-specific complications. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 39. CONCLUSIONS: This case demonstrates that NRP can be applied effectively in small pediatric donors, yielding excellent early graft function. Our experience adds to the emerging literature on pediatric NRP. We conclude that broader adoption of NRP could help increase the donor pool and ease the strain on the pediatric waiting list.","Fischer, R. M. J.; Abdelaal, A.; Sweet, A.; Muñoz, N.; Abt, P.

A considerable proportion of patients on the liver transplant waiting list do not receive a transplant, often due to clinical deterioration or death. Several strategies exist to expand the organ pool for liver transplantation. The most commonly used approaches include living-donor liver transplantation, splitting a deceased donor liver into two grafts, and utilizing marginal donor grafts. Less frequently employed methods include donation after circulatory death (DCD), domino transplantation, and the reuse of previously transplanted livers. It is also crucial to optimize their utilization by carefully matching them with lower-risk recipients. There are some case reports and small series of cases regarding the successful reuse of liver grafts in the early and late post-transplant periods. We report the first case of the reuse of a deceased donor liver graft in Chile. A 51-year-old woman with fulminant liver failure initially received the graft, which was later donated following her brain death caused by an intracerebral hemorrhage. After undergoing two additional hours of ex situ hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE), the graft was successfully transplanted into a 55-year-old man with autoimmune hepatitis.

Despite prolonged warm ischemia time, Italian centers reported good outcomes in controlled donation after circulatory death LT by combining normothermic regional and end-ischemic machine perfusion. However, data on uncontrolled DCD (uDCD) LT performed by this approach are lacking. This was a multicenter, retrospective study performed at 3 large-volume centers comparing clinical outcomes of uncontrolled versus controlled DCD LT. The aim of the study was to assess outcomes of sequential normothermic regional perfusion and end-ischemic machine perfusion in uncontrolled DCD liver transplantation (LT). Of 153 DCD donors evaluated during the study period, 40 uDCD and 59 donation after circulatory death grafts were transplanted (utilization rate 52% vs. 78%, p = 0.004). Recipients of uDCD grafts had higher MEAF (4.9 vs. 3.5, p < 0.001) and CCI scores at discharge (24.4 vs. 8.7, p = 0.026), longer ICU stay (5 vs. 4 d, p = 0.047), and a trend toward more severe AKI. At multivariate analysis, 90-day graft loss was associated with recipient BMI and lactate downtrend during normothermic regional perfusion. One-year graft survival was lower in uDCD (75% vs. 90%, p = 0.007) but became comparable when non-liver-related graft losses were treated as censors (77% vs. 90%, p = 0.100). The incidence of ischemic cholangiopathy was 10% in uDCD versus 3% in donation after circulatory death, p = 0.356. uDCD LT with prolonged warm ischemia is feasible by the sequential use of normothermic regional perfusion and end-ischemic machine perfusion.

MASLD is associated with severe medical burdens and leads to further reduction of the donor pool for liver transplantation. However, there is a lack of systematic evaluation of the pathogenesis of MASLD development and MASLD graft damage. As a multisystem disorder, the pathogenesis of MASLD is closely related to genetics, metabolic and endocrine disorders, imbalanced intestinal flora, abnormal hepatocyte homeostasis, and hepatic inflammation. Mutations or single nucleotide polymorphisms and epigenetic modifications in multiple genes increase a person's susceptibility to developing MASLD. Lipid accumulation is a central pathogenic driver, and intestinal microbiota and endocrine disorders can exacerbate steatosis and inflammation. These issues cause endoplasmic reticulum stress in hepatocytes, leading to apoptosis and promoting the recruitment and activation of immune cells. Ultimately, hepatic stellate cells are activated, resulting in liver fibrosis. These molecular and pathological changes are important causes of why a MASLD donor liver is likely to suffer ischemia-reperfusion injury and cold ischemic injury. Lipid deposition, microcirculation disturbance, and inflammation in the MASLD donor liver exacerbates ischemia-reperfusion-related damage. During transplantation, cold ischemia time should be minimized, and machine perfusion implemented and treatments for MASLD used after transplantation to protect the graft. This systematic review describes the pathogenesis of MASLD and the mechanism of MASLD donor liver damage to potentially increase the use of MASLD donor livers and provide strategies to preserve organ function.","Gou, C.; Zhang, W.; Xu, H.; Zhang, H.; Ding, R.; Zhang, X.",2025,Iliver,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors evaluated combined cladribine, idarubicin, and cytarabine (CLIA) in a phase 2 trial of 66 patients with R/R AML. METHODS: Patients received induction with cladribine 5 mg/m(2) intravenously (days 1-5), cytarabine 1000 mg/m(2) intravenously (days 1-5), and idarubicin 10 mg/m(2) intravenously (days 1-3; CLIA). Sorafenib 400 mg twice daily (days 1-14) was added for FLT3-mutated AML. RESULTS: The composite response rate (complete remission [CR] plus complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery [CRi]) was 33%; salvage 1 (S1) patients (n = 35) had a CR/CRi rate of 49%. After a 61-month median follow-up, the median overall survival (OS) was 7.9 months, with a median relapse-free survival (RFS) of 9.1 months for those in CR/CRi. The median OS for S1 patients was 12 months, with a median RFS of 10.3 months. For those who received CLIA with sorafenib (n = 22), the CR/CRi rate was 41%, median OS was 8.8 months, and median RFS was 3.8 months. Landmark analysis demonstrated superior OS for patients who proceeded to transplantation compared with patients who did not (median OS, 78 vs. 8.8 months, respectively; p < .001). The 4-week and 8-week mortality rates were 6% and 17%, respectively. Most grade >3 adverse events were related to infection and elevated liver function tests. CONCLUSIONS: CLIA is effective for patients with R/R AML and offers a safety profile similar to that of other intensive regimens (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02115295).","Goulart, H.; Kantarjian, H.; Borthakur, G.; Daver, N.; DiNardo, C.

However, the expansion of indications is going to worsen the chronic scarcity of organs, and new strategies are needed to enlarge the donor pool. A possible source of organs could be developing split liver transplantation programs. We propose to refer donors aged 18-50 years unsuitable for pediatric patients and donors aged 50-60 years for split evaluation. This will generate new small left lateral grafts that can be used for resection and partial liver segment II-III transplantation with delayed total hepatectomy procedures, based on a national waiting list specifically for non-HCC oncologic patients. Centralized imaging review will streamline the donor-recipient matching process and address organizational challenges. Additionally, adopting an ex situ splitting technique during hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion could further enhance logistical efficiency and improve graft viability. The proposed protocol (ALERT 50) will therefore promote the development of oncologic indications without affecting the standard waiting list and without competing with urgent or pediatric patients.","Gringeri, E.; Furlanetto, A.; Polacco, M.; Perin, L.; Nieddu, E.; Rosso, E.; De Nardi, C.; Ballo, M.; De Feo, T.; Trapani, S.; Burra, P.; Spada, M.; Colledan, M.; Lauterio, A.; Romagnoli, R.; Cardillo, M.; Feltrin, G.; De Carlis, L.; Cillo, U.",2025,Liver Transpl,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Traditionally, liver grafts undergo a second cooling phase before implantation, which may contribute to cellular damage through ischemia-reperfusion injury. In this ""How To Do It"" article, we describe our surgical technique to avoid re-cooling following NMP. Specifically, after retrieval from the perfusion device, the graft is directly inserted into the surgical field and undergoes a standardized portal flush with 1 L of 5% albumin at room temperature before reperfusion. This method maintains physiological temperature, potentially reducing reperfusion stress and enhancing graft function. We detail step-by-step procedural aspects, including organ handling, vascular anastomoses, and intraoperative considerations, supported by our clinical outcomes.","Gruttadauria, S.; Vella, I.; Calamia, S.; Li Petri, S.; Accardo, C.; Pagano, D.; di Francesco, F.",2025,Asaio j,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) and normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) are increasingly used in renal transplantation. Both techniques enable pretransplant organ viability assessment through biomarker measurements in the perfusion solution. This study examines similarities and differences in biomarker release during HMP and NMP, focusing on well-established biomarkers alongside functional markers in porcine and discarded human donor kidneys., Methods. Discarded human donor kidneys (n = 25) underwent 4 h of oxygenated hypothermic machine perfusion (HMPO2) and subsequently 4 h of NMP. Porcine kidneys were exposed to either minimal warm ischemia or 75 min of warm ischemia (n = 30 per group). Hereafter, kidneys were placed on HMPO2 for 6 h followed by 6 h of NMP. Flow dynamics were recorded, and the biomarkers aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), N-acetyl-[beta]-glucosaminidase, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2), and heart-type fatty acid-binding protein were measured longitudinally in the perfusates., Results. For human kidneys, we found moderate to strong correlations between ASAT, LDH, TIMP-2, and heart-type fatty acid-binding protein content measured during HMPO2 and the same biomarkers during NMP. In porcine kidneys, clear distinctions between ischemically damaged and healthy kidneys were observed in flow dynamics and content of ASAT, LDH, and TIMP-2 during both HMPO2 and NMP., Conclusions. Our findings suggest that biomarker release during HMPO2 and NMP have similarities, indicating that some biomarkers might already be assessed during HMPO2. However, the predictive value of biomarkers in both techniques remains elusive. Additionally, NMP could provide important benefits over HMPO2, including functional assessment and reconditioning., Copyright (C) 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Experimental ex-situ organ perfusion incorporating cross-circulation with a live animal has achieved significantly longer safe ex-situ preservation times; however, the underlying mechanisms are not clear. METHODS: In this study, combined ex-situ heart-liver perfusion of porcine hearts was compared to ex-situ isolated heart perfusion. Discarded human donor hearts were also perfused ex-situ and cardiac function and metabolism was studied. RESULTS: The hearts perfused together with liver were preserved significantly better, with lower edema, preserved key nutrients, and lower oxidative stress, (comparable to in vivo samples). Human donor hearts subjected to ex-situ perfusion had similar function and oxidative patterns compared to isolated porcine hearts, suggesting these hearts are vulnerable to the same phenomena as porcine hearts.

173,40754005.0,10.1111/jgh.70037,Unraveling Liver Cirrhosis: Bridging Pathophysiology to Innovative Therapeutics,"Liver cirrhosis is a complex and progressive condition resulting from sustained liver injury and chronic inflammation. Characterized by extensive fibrosis, disrupted liver architecture, and impaired function, cirrhosis represents the end stage of many chronic liver diseases. While traditionally considered irreversible, emerging evidence suggests that targeted interventions may modify disease progression, offering new hope for patients. This review explores the evolving understanding of liver cirrhosis, integrating insights into pathophysiology, systemic implications and innovative therapeutic approaches. At the core of cirrhosis development lies the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), driven by a cascade of pro-fibrotic signals, including transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and Wnt/β-catenin pathways. Recent studies highlight the pivotal role of epigenetic regulation, mechanotransduction and cellular crosstalk in perpetuating fibrogenesis. Advances in single-cell transcriptomics and spatial biology are revealing unprecedented details of the cellular and molecular heterogeneity within cirrhotic tissue. Beyond the liver, cirrhosis exerts systemic effects, involving the gut-liver axis, vascular remodeling, and multi-organ dysfunction. The gut microbiome has emerged as a critical modulator, with dysbiosis and microbial translocation contributing to inflammation and disease progression. Therapeutic strategies targeting microbiome restoration, such as probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), are showing promise. Diagnostics are undergoing a paradigm shift with the advent of noninvasive tools, including elastography and liquid biopsy technologies. Circulating biomarkers, such as extracellular vesicles and noncoding RNAs, offer real-time insights into disease dynamics. On the therapeutic front, anti-fibrotic agents, senolytics, and regenerative approaches, such as stem cell therapy and liver organoids, are being explored. As artificial intelligence and computational modeling enhance predictive capabilities, a precision medicine approach to cirrhosis management is becoming feasible. This review highlights the need for interdisciplinary research to translate these advances into effective clinical solutions, bridging the gap between pathophysiology and innovative therapeutics.","Hegazy, R.

129,40189968.0,10.1016/j.jhep.2025.01.042,Deceased donor liver utilisation and assessment: Consensus guidelines from the European Liver and Intestine Transplant Association,"Over the past two decades, the application of machine perfusion (MP) in human liver transplantation has moved from the realm of clinical exploration to routine clinical practice. Both in situ and ex situ perfusion strategies are feasible, safe, and may offer improvements in relevant post-transplant outcomes. An important utility of these strategies is the ability to transplant grafts traditionally considered too risky to transplant using conventional cold storage alone. While dynamic assessment and ultimately transplantation of such livers is an important goal for the international liver transplant community, its clinical application is inconsistent. To this end, ELITA (the European Liver and Intestine Transplant Association) gathered a panel of experts to create consensus guidelines regarding selection, approach, and criteria for deceased donor liver assessment in the MP era. An eight-member steering committee (SC) convened a panel of 44 professionals working in 14 countries in Europe and North America. The SC identified topics related to liver utilisation and assessment for transplantation. For each topic, subtopics were created to answer specific clinical questions. A systematic literature review was performed, and the panel graded relevant evidence. The SC drafted initial statements addressing each clinical question. Statements were presented at the in-person Consensus Meeting on Liver Discard and Viability Assessment during the ELITA Summit held from April 19-20, 2024, in Madrid, Spain. Online voting was held to approve statements according to a modified Delphi method; statements reaching ≥85% agreement were approved.

With organ transplantation offering hope to patients with end-stage organ disease, understanding the incidence and risk factors of POD is crucial, as it can significantly affect patients' prognosis and healthcare costs. AIM: To systematically evaluate the incidence and risk factors of POD following organ transplantation to facilitate clinical prevention and optimize patient management and prognosis. METHODS: Multiple databases such as PubMed and their reference lists were comprehensively searched using a combination of keywords related to organ transplantation and POD. Relevant observational studies on patients who had undergone solid organ transplantation and randomized controlled trials containing relevant analyses were included. Duplicated, data-deficient, non-English, and non-original data studies were excluded. Data were extracted independently by two researchers and then cross-checked. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to evaluate the quality of the included studies. RevMan 5.3 was employed for data analysis. The pooled incidence of POD was calculated according to the data type, and the fixed or random effect model was employed to analyze risk factors based on heterogeneity. Subsequently, sensitivity analysis and publication bias assessments were performed. RESULTS: A total of 39 relevant literatures were included. The overall incidence of POD in the organ transplant group was 20% [95% confidence interval (CI): 18%-22%]; liver transplant group, 22% (95%CI: 17%-26%); lung transplant group, 34% (95%CI: 23%-45%); and kidney transplant group, 6% (95%CI: 2%-10%). Primary graft dysfunction increased the POD risk, with a pooled odds ratio (OR) (95%CI) of 1.78 (1.09-2.91). A history of hepatic encephalopathy increased the POD risk, with a pooled OR (95%CI) of 3.19 (2.30-4.43). The higher the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, the greater the POD risk, with a pooled OR (95%CI) of 1.52 (1.09-2.12). A history of alcohol abuse increased the POD risk, with a pooled OR (95%CI) of 2.84 (1.74-4.65). Thus, the higher the model for end-stage liver disease score, the greater the POD risk, with a pooled OR (95%CI) of 2.49 (1.14-5.43). POD was more likely to develop in patients with preoperative infections, with a pooled OR (95%CI) of 2.78 (1.56-4.97). The use of diuretics increased the POD risk, with a pooled OR (95%CI) of 2.36 (1.38-4.04). CONCLUSION: In this study, the overall incidence of POD in patients who underwent organ transplantation is 20%. The incidence varies among different types of organ transplantation, and multiple factors can increase the POD risk.","Hou, S. S.; Liu, J.; Qiao, P. F.; Yang, D. G.; Huang, L.

253,39812559.0,10.1530/vb-24-0004,Protection of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells using different preservation solutions,"Donor liver preservation methods and solutions have evolved over the last years. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cell (LSEC) barrier function and integrity during preservation are crucial for outcomes of liver transplantation. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine optimal preservation of LSEC barrier function and integrity using different preservation solutions. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and LSECs were incubated in either University of Wisconsin machine perfusion solution (UW-MPS), histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate, or endothelial cell growth medium 2 (EGM2) (as a gold standard for cell culturing). Endothelial integrity was assessed by measurement of cellular morphology and expression of membrane proteins: PECAM-1, ICAM-1 and Fc-gamma receptor CD32b (FcΥRCD32b). Endothelial barrier function was measured by electric cell-substrate impedance sensing. Cellular response to inflammatory stimuli with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) was tested by studying trans-endothelial migration (TEM) under flow conditions. Differences in these parameters were analyzed between the different preservation solutions. PECAM-1 expression was high for all preservation solutions in HUVECs and LSECs. ICAM-1 expression was increased in both LSECs and HUVECs in all preservation solutions plus TNF-α. UW reduced PECAM-1 expression, whereas EGM2 medium promoted barrier function in LSECs and HUVECs, and monolayer recovery after wounding was best achieved in cells incubated in EGM2. LSECs and HUVECs incubated with EGM2 plus TNF-α both supported neutrophil adhesion and TEM, but much less to none when incubated in UW plus TNF-α. Overall, EGM2 showed the best results in preserving endothelial barrier function for both HUVECs and LSECs.","Houtzager, J. H. E.; van Stalborch, A. M.; Hofstee, C.; van Gulik, T. M.; van Buul, J.

Recent advances in comprehensive treatment strategies, particularly the combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapy, offer new hope. To further improve efficacy while lowering radiation doses, nanopharmaceuticals based on high-Z elements have been extensively studied in radio-immunotherapy. In this work, a hafnium-based metal-organic framework (Hf-MOF), UiO-66-Hf(2OH)-CB-839/BSO@HA (UiO-66-Hf(2OH)-C/B@HA), was designed to codeliver telaglenastat (CB-839) and buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), which synergistically inhibited glutamine metabolism and alleviated tumor hypoxia. Further modification with hyaluronic acid (HA) enhanced tumor targeting, ultimately strengthening the efficacy of radiotherapy in MYC-amplified HCC. Beyond increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, promoting DNA damage, and inducing tumor apoptosis, more importantly, UiO66-Hf(2OH)-C/B@HA triggered immunogenic cell death (ICD), driving the antitumor immune response. Combination with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) further enhanced the efficacy, accompanied by increased infiltration of T cells with high granzyme B expression (GZMB(+) T cells) within the tumor microenvironment (TME). In the orthotopic HCC model, established with MYC-amplified tumor cells, intravenous administration of UiO66-Hf(2OH)-C/B@HA significantly potentiated the efficacy of radio-immunotherapy, resulting in superior tumor regression. In summary, our study provides insights into the design of Hf-MOF for radio-immunotherapy and proposes a promising therapeutic approach for MYC-amplified HCC.","Hu, H.; Ning, S.; Liu, F.; Zhang, Z.; Zeng, W.; Liu, Y.; Liao, Z.; Zhang, H.; Zhang, Z.",2025,ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) is becoming the main preservation method for donation after circulatory death (DCD) kidneys. It can provide continuous flow and form shear stress (SS) upon endothelial cells (ECs), thereby regulating EC injury. Kruppel-like factor 10 (KLF10) has been shown to lessen vascular damage. However, how SS and KLF10 impact HMP-regulated injury is unclear., Methods. In this study, we investigated the influences of KLF10 on HMP in animal models and human renal biopsy and explored how SS affected KLF10 expression in a parallel-plate flow chamber system. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing and luciferase assay were performed to seek the target genes of KLF10. The influences of KLF10 on HMP-regulated injury were investigated by transfecting si-KLF10 adeno-associated virus serotype 9 into rat kidneys. The molecular expression was examined using immunofluorescence staining, Western blotting, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction., Results. Our results show KLF10 expression was augmented in human, rabbit, and rat DCD kidneys after HMP. HMP improved ECs and tubule injury and attenuated inflammation; however, the knockdown of KLF10 reversed this effect. SS regulated KLF10 expression in ECs by affecting F-actin, and KLF10 could maintain ECs homeostasis. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing and luciferase assay revealed that baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis protein repeat-containing 2 (BIRC2) is a target gene of KLF10. Furthermore, BIRC2 linked to nuclear factor kappa B (NF-[kappa]B)-inducing kinase, induced NF-[kappa]B)-inducing kinase ubiquitination, and resulted in inhibiting the noncanonical NF-[kappa]B pathway., Conclusions. SS can mediate KLF10 expression, whereas HMP can protect against warm ischemic injury by reducing inflammation via KLF10/BIRC2/noncanonical NF-[kappa]B pathway. Therefore, KLF10 might be a novel target for improving DCD kidney quality., Copyright (C) 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Due to the organ shortage, there has been an uptick in the use of circulatory death donors (DCD), yet DCD kidneys endure severe ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), limiting transplantation efficacy. Therefore, we developed a strategy combining hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) with aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) agonist Alda-1, using quaternized chitosan/5β-cholanic acid/Alda-1 nanoparticles (A-NCH) for ex vivo DCD kidney repair. Methodologically, A-NCH was synthesized by conjugating O-hydroxypropyl trimethylammonium chloride chitosan (O-HTCC) with 5β-cholanic acid via EDC/NHS-mediated coupling, forming self-assembled micelles with a mean diameter of 132.4 ± 0.3 nm and ζ-potential of 45.0 ± 1.0 mV. It exhibited a high drug loading ratio (41.9%), with 80% of Alda-1 released at 4 °C within 3.5 h following the Weibull model, enabling sustained drug delivery during HMP. A-NCH demonstrated outstanding compatibility with cells and blood, as well as effective antibacterial properties combat Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. In vitro, A-NCH reduced H(2)O(2)- and oxygen-glucose deprivation- and -reoxygenation-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in HK-2 and HUVECs. In vivo, using a rat DCD kidney transplantation model, A-NCH-administered HMP accelerated kidney graft function recovery and alleviated renal tubular injury. Mechanistically, A-NCH activated ALDH2, inhibited the P38 MAPK pathway, promoted nuclear translocation of TEAD4/YAP1, and suppressed the transition of proximal tubule cells to an injured phenotype. In this study, the solubility and drug loading of Alda-1 were improved by 5β-cholanic acid modification of O-HTCC, which proved the synergistic efficacy with HMP in DCD kidney repair and provided a translatable strategy to expand the donor pool.","Hu, Q.; Lu, Z.; Yasen, K.; Liu, A.; Shi, X.; Ye, Q.; Zhong, Z.",2025,ACS Nano,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Early, non-invasive detection is essential for timely intervention and improved survival. To address this clinical need, we developed GutSeer, a blood-based assay combining DNA methylation and fragmentomics for multi-GI cancer detection. METHODS: Genome-wide methylome profiling identified 1,656 markers specific to five major GI cancers and their tissue origins. Based on these findings, we designed GutSeer, a targeted bisulfite sequencing panel, which was trained and validated using plasma samples from 1,057 cancer patients and 1,415 non-cancer controls. The locked model was blindly tested in an independent cohort of 846 participants, encompassing both inpatient and outpatient settings across five hospitals. RESULTS: In the validation cohort, GutSeer achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.950 [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.937-0.962] for cancer detection, with 82.8% sensitivity (95% CI: 79.5-86.0) and 95.8% specificity (95% CI: 94.3-97.2). It detected 92.2% of colorectal, 75.5% of esophageal, 65.3% of gastric, 92.9% of liver, and 88.6% of pancreatic cancers. The independent test cohort included 198 early-stage cancers (stage I/II, 66.4%) and 63 advanced precancerous lesions. GutSeer maintained robust performance, with 81.5% sensitivity (95% CI: 77.1-85.9) for GI cancers and 94.4% specificity (95% CI: 92.4-96.5). It also demonstrated the ability to detect advanced precancerous lesions in the colorectum, esophagus, and stomach as a single, non-invasive blood test. CONCLUSIONS: By integrating DNA methylation and fragmentomics into a compact panel, GutSeer outperformed genome-wide sequencing in both accuracy and clinical applicability. Its high sensitivity for early-stage GI cancers and practicality as a non-invasive assay highlights its potential to revolutionize early cancer detection and improve patient outcomes.

Current therapeutic challenges arise from interconnected cell death pathways and redundant inflammatory mechanisms. OBJECTIVE: This review synthesizes mechanistic insights into DAMP signaling and regulated cell death modalities in IRI, aiming to identify translational gaps and propose precision-targeted therapies. METHODS: A literature search in PubMed using keywords ""IRI,"" ""DAMPs,"" and cell death modes was conducted without date restrictions. Peer-reviewed studies on human/animal models were included, with qualitative synthesis of DAMP-cell death interactions. RESULTS: During ischemia, mitochondrial dysfunction releases HMGB1, ATP, and mtDNA, activating Kupffer cell TLR4/RAGE and cGAS-STING pathways, triggering NLRP3 inflammasome-- driven cytokine storms. Reperfusion amplifies ROS bursts, lipid peroxidation, and iron overload, creating a self-sustaining cycle of damage. Cell death modalities exhibit spatiotemporal specificity: hepatocyte ferroptosis dominates early injury, while macrophage pyroptosis and necroptosis predominate in steatotic livers during late phases. HMGB1 lactylation and mtDNA-cGAS signaling emerge as key regulators. Machine perfusion (e.g., hypothermic oxygenated perfusion) reduces biliary complications via mitochondrial resuscitation, outperforming conventional drugbased therapies. CONCLUSION: Current single-pathway targeting shows limited efficacy due to IRI's complexity.

Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy has emerged as a game-changing approach, leveraging its potent immunomodulatory, anti-fibrotic, and regenerative capabilities, along with the ability to transdifferentiate into hepatocytes. This review delves into the latest advances in MSC-based treatments for chronic and end-stage liver diseases, as highlighted in current clinical trials. MSCs derived from bone marrow and umbilical cord have shown remarkable promise in reversing liver damage, improving liver function, and providing hope for patients who do not respond to conventional therapies. When administered through hepatic, portal, or peripheral veins, MSCs have significantly improved liver histology, reduced fibrosis, and restored functional capacity. Furthermore, MSC-derived materials, such as extracellular vesicles and exosomes, are emerging as cutting-edge tools for treating liver failure and mitigating post-transplant complications. While autologous MSC-derived hepatocytes hold promise for non-fatal cirrhosis, allogeneic MSCs are being applied in more severe conditions, including liver failure and transplantation cases. Despite these promising early outcomes, larger trials and long-term studies are essential to fully harness MSCs as a transformative, off-the-shelf alternative to liver transplantation, heralding a new era in regenerative liver therapies.","Huang, W.

Machine perfusion is the preferred preservation method for deceased donor kidneys. Perfusate fluid, which contains a complex mixture of components, offers potential insight into the organ's viability and function. This study explored immune cell release, particularly tissue-resident lymphocytes (TRLs), during donor kidney machine perfusion and its correlation with injury markers., Methods. Perfusate samples from hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP; n = 26) and normothermic machine perfusion (NMP; n = 16) of human donor kidneys were analyzed for TRLs using flow cytometry. Residency was defined by expressions of CD69, CD103, and CD49as. TRL release was quantified exclusively in NMP. Additionally, levels of cell-free DNA, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, and soluble E-cadherin (sE-cadherin) were measured in NMP supernatants with quantitative polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay., Results. Both HMP and NMP samples contained a heterogeneous population of TRLs, including CD4+ tissue-resident memory T cells, CD8+ tissue-resident memory T cells, tissue-resident natural killer cells, tissue-resident natural killer T cells, and helper-like innate lymphoid cells. Median TRL proportions among total CD45+ lymphocytes were 0.89% (NMP) and 0.84% (HMP). TRL quantities in NMP did not correlate with donor characteristics, perfusion parameters, posttransplant outcomes, or cell-free DNA and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin concentrations. However, CD103+ TRL release positively correlated with the release of sE-cadherin, the ligand for the CD103 integrin., Conclusions. Human donor kidneys release TRLs during both HMP and NMP. The release of CD103+ TRLs was associated with the loss of their ligand sE-cadherin but not with general transplant injury biomarkers., Copyright (C) 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Whereas allografts continuously degrade during static cold storage, short-term perfusion can preserve high-quality organs for hours, enabling assessment, regional transport and improved logistics. Long-term perfusion for multiple days might extend the potential of clinical machine perfusion in the future, allowing for the assessment, reconditioning and repair of marginal or injured grafts for which more time is needed. In addition, it might convert transplantation, which is now semi-elective thanks to short-term perfusion, to a fully elective procedure via customized machines and associated protocols that maintain organs ex situ for up to 2 weeks. The advent of long-term organ perfusion provides tremendous potential to improve organ evaluation and selection, to recondition or repair marginal grafts and, ultimately, to expand the pool of grafts available for transplantation. In this Perspective, we discuss design considerations, guidelines for use, and future perspectives of machine perfusion in the context of organ assessment and repair, with a focus on the liver.","Huwyler, F.; Binz, J.; Cunningham, L.; Pfister, M.; Schuler, M.

Despite the success of split liver transplantation (SLT) in improving pediatric access to transplants, its utilization remains limited. This review examines barriers to SLT adoption, explores the impact of pediatric-focused allocation policies, and evaluates the potential of machine perfusion technology in expanding the pediatric donor pool. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies have demonstrated that SLT outcomes are comparable to whole graft transplants when performed at experienced centers. However, logistical challenges, technical expertise, and policy limitations hinder its widespread adoption. Countries with pediatric-prioritized allocation and mandatory SLT policies, such as Italy and the United Kingdom, have significantly reduced pediatric waitlist mortality. Additionally, machine perfusion technology has emerged as a promising solution, allowing for ex vivo graft splitting and reducing ischemic injury, which may enhance graft utilization. SUMMARY: A multifaceted approach is necessary to improve pediatric liver transplant outcomes, including stronger pediatric-first allocation policies, SLT training expansion, and integration of machine perfusion technologies. Implementing these strategies in the United States could significantly reduce pediatric waitlist mortality without negatively impacting adult transplant candidates.","Hwang, C. S.; Aqul, A.

221,40387086.0,10.1111/ans.70176,Enhancing Organ Availability: Increased DCD Liver Utilization Following Implementation of a Normothermic Machine Perfusion Program,"In Australia, donation after circulatory death (DCD) liver utilization remains below that of comparable healthcare systems in the Northern Hemisphere, due to concerns over higher rates of early hepatocellular dysfunction/nonfunction and ischemic cholangiopathy, coupled with limited organ availability and challenging organ transport logistics. To address this, the Queensland Liver Transplant Service introduced the OrganOx Metra normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) device in 2018. Positive outcomes were initially reported for 10 livers, including five DCD livers deemed unsuitable for static cold storage (SCS). This retrospective, historical-control study evaluated whether NMP availability improved DCD liver utilization. The NMP era (June 2018 to June 2021) was compared to the SCS era (June 2015 to June 2018), with all DCD activity included, regardless of the preservation technique. Donor data were sourced from the DonateLife Queensland database, and patient outcome data were gathered from the electronic medical records of Princess Alexandra Hospital, Queensland. The NMP era showed significantly higher rates for medically suitable DCD offers(90.5% vs. 66.1%, p < 0.01), higher rates of formal DCD offers (88.1% vs. 61.0%, p < 0.01), greater DCD planned retrieval rate (56.6% vs. 23.7%, p < 0.01), and higher implantation rate as a proportion of all DCD offers (18.8% vs. 5.9%, p < 0.01). More potentially viable DCD grafts were declined because of the lack of suitable recipients, suggesting an abundance of available livers and reduced waitlist. Despite increased DCD utilization and a higher mean modified UK DCD risk score in the NMP era (1.5 vs. 0, p = 0.05), there was no increase in early allograft dysfunction, primary nonfunction, ischemic cholangiopathy, or re-transplantation.","Idrees, M.

The soluble form of its primary ligand, sPD-L1, was found to be elevated in the serum of patients with cancer, infectious diseases, and chronic inflammation. So far, the hepatic origin of sPD-L1 has received relatively little attention and is therefore the subject of this study in the context of normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) of liver grafts. sPD-L1 concentrations as well as several well-established clinically relevant laboratory parameters were determined in the perfusate of 16 donor liver grafts undergoing NMP up to 30 hours. sPD-L1 levels continuously increased during NMP and significantly correlated with markers of hepatic synthesis (cholinesterase), acute-phase proteins (von Willebrand factor, procalcitonin, antithrombin, interleukin-6, fibrinogen), and liver decay markers (gamma-glutamyltransferase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase). Perfusate leukocytes were in the lower reference range and decreased after 12 hours. Mean sPD-L1 levels in the perfusate correlated with donor levels of gamma-glutamyltransferase, alanine aminotransferase, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen. Our study reveals a significant increase in the concentration of sPD-L1 following ischemia-reperfusion injury in a hepatic ex vivo model. sPD-L1 concentrations during NMP correlate with established acute-phase proteins and liver cell decay markers, suggesting that hepatic sPD-L1 synthesis or shedding increases during the acute phase and cell decay. Furthermore, sPD-L1 correlates with established liver function and synthesis parameters as well as with donor laboratory values and might therefore be a potential biomarker for the hepatic function of liver grafts.","Irsara, C.; Weissenbacher, A.; Krendl, F.

Here, to explore intrinsic and extrinsic regulation of FL-HSC self-renewal at the single cell level, we engineered a culture platform designed to recapitulate the FL endothelial niche, which supports the ex vivo amplification of serially engraftable HSCs. Leveraging this platform in combination with single cell index flow cytometry, live imaging, serial transplantation assays, and single cell RNA-sequencing, we uncovered previously unrecognized heterogeneity within immunophenotypically defined FL-HSCs. Specifically, we demonstrated that differentiation latency, symmetric cell divisions, and transcriptional signatures of biosynthetic dormancy and lipid metabolism are distinguishing properties of rare FL-HSCs capable of serial, long-term multilineage hematopoietic reconstitution. Our findings support a paradigm in which intrinsic programs and extrinsic signals combinatorially facilitate the symmetric self-renewal and expansion of nascent HSCs in the FL niche while delaying their active participation in hematopoiesis. Additionally, our study provides a valuable resource for future investigations into the intrinsic and niche-derived signaling pathways that govern FL-HSC self-renewal.","Ishida, T.; Mercoli, J.; Heck, A.

Yet up to 3 quarters of donor lungs remain discarded across the globe. Multiday preservation of discarded human lungs on EVLP platforms would improve donor lung utilization rates via application of sophisticated treatment modalities, which could eventually result in zero waitlist mortality. The purpose of this article is to summarize advances made on the technical aspects of the protocols in achieving a stable multiday preservation of isolated EVLP. Based on the evidence derived from large animal and/or human studies, the following advances have been considered important in achieving this goal: ability to reposition donor lungs during EVLP; perfusate adsorption/filtration modalities; perfusate enrichment with plasma and/or donor whole blood, nutrients, vitamins, and amino acids; low-flow, pulsatile, and subnormothermic perfusion; positive outflow pressure; injury specific personalized ventilation strategies; and negative pressure ventilation. Combination of some of these advances in an automatized EVLP device capable of managing perfusate biochemistry and ventilation would likely speed up the processes of achieving multiday preservation of isolated EVLP., Copyright (C) 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

NRP is associated with better liver transplant outcomes and allows increased risk thresholds for medically complex DCD donors. DCD donors on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are a category of medically complex donors lacking significant reported experience. OBJECTIVES: This brief report describes the utilization of liver grafts from ECMO-DCD donors using an NRP procurement technique. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of donor and recipient outcomes in 3 cases following abdominal DCD-NRP with ECMO cannula exchange to an NRP circuit. Existing cannulas and tubing can be used for NRP inflow, outflow, or both depending on the configuration. RESULTS: All donors were older than the age of 50 y and had a functional warm ischemia time of <30 min. NRP duration ranged from 66 to 134 min. All 3 donors demonstrated lactate clearance while on NRP. Recipient age ranged from 52 to 68 and model for end-stage liver disease scores were 22, 26, and 7. All had a 1-d intensive care unit stay and 5- to 7-d total hospital length of stay. One of the 3 recipients had a biliary anastomotic stricture. CONCLUSIONS: This report demonstrates the technical and clinical feasibility of liver transplantation from ECMO-DCD-NRP donors. Preoperative planning for the utilization of existing cannulas, the addition of needed inflow or outflow, and circuit exchange logistics is essential for a smooth transition to NRP in these cases.","Jacques, A.; Walker, O.; Monday, K.; Schwartz, G.; Richards, G.; Duncan, M.; Bayer, J.; Lee, S.

Absent established pharmacologic interventions against this progressive etiology of allograft dysfunction and failure, we describe the use of fenofibrate-a cheap and widely-accessible peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonist that downregulates bile acid production-to impede IC progression in 15 DCD liver recipients who were not responding to reactive, standard-of-care management. All patients were undergoing serial endoscopic retrograde cholangiopathy (ERC) to maintain biliary patency but demonstrated progressive cholestasis, with serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) rising 70.3% over the 90 days preceding fenofibrate. Cholestasis improved in all patients after fenofibrate initiation, with a 63.9% reduction in mean ALP at 90 days, maintained at 270 days (p = 0.02) and 360 days (p = 0.06). ALP improvement was associated with reduced ERC frequency during and after fenofibrate treatment, and this improvement was independent of concurrent ERC or ursodeoxycholic acid use during fenofibrate treatment. In patients who stopped treatment, ALP increased. No fenofibrate-associated adverse events were seen. These preliminary data support the further study of agents that downregulate bile acid production as a means of impeding IC in DCD livers.","Jayasekera, C. R.; Barnhill, M.; Chascsa, D. M.

Although quantitative tools such as the Donor Risk Index (DRI) help assess organ suitability, many potentially viable organs are still discarded due to the lack of universally accepted markers to predict post-transplant outcomes. Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) offers a platform to assess viability before transplantation. Thus, livers considered unsuitable for transplantation based on the DRI can be evaluated and potentially transplanted. During NMP, various viability criteria have been proposed. These criteria are neither homogeneous nor consensual. In this review, we aimed to describe the viability criteria during NMP and evaluate their ability to predict hepatic graft function following transplantation. We conducted a PubMed search using the terms 'liver transplantation', 'normothermic machine perfusion' and 'assessment', including only English publications up to February 2024. Viability assessment during NMP includes multiple hepatocellular and cholangiocellular criteria. Lactate clearance and bile production are commonly used indicators, but their ability to predict post-transplant outcomes varies significantly. The predictive value of cholangiocellular criteria such as bile pH, bicarbonate and glucose levels remains under investigation. Novel markers, such as microRNAs and proteomic profiles, offer the potential to enhance graft evaluation accuracy and provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying liver viability. Combining perfusion parameters with biomarkers may improve the prediction of long-term graft survival. Future research should focus on standardising viability assessment protocols and exploring real-time biomarker evaluations, which could enhance transplantation outcomes and expand the donor pool.","Jeddou, H.; Tzedakis, S.; Chaouch, M.

METHODS: We systematically reviewed RCTs comparing end-ischemic NMP with SCS in adult liver transplantation (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL to July 9, 2025). Outcomes of interest included early allograft dysfunction (EAD), organ utilization, patient and graft survival, peak AST, primary non-function (PNF), and biliary complications. RESULTS: Four RCTs (801 patients; NMP 418; SCS 383) met inclusion. NMP reduced EAD [16.4% vs. 27.2%; RR 0.61, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.38-0.99; p = 0.05] and increased organ utilization (75.5% vs. 69.4%; RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02-1.18; p = 0.01). No significant differences were observed for patient or graft survival, peak AST, PNF, or biliary complications, though the latter trended in favor of NMP (RR 0.73, p = 0.07).

Although flushing hepatic grafts prior to reperfusion have been well explored, the optimal graft rinse solution to prevent cold IR injury remains largely undefined. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a new rinse solution combining polyethylene glycol PM 35,000 Da (PEG35) with lactated solution (RLS) could mitigate cold IR injury in Wistar rats. METHODS: Livers were isolated, preserved for 24 h and flushed immediately before ex vivo reperfusion with either RLS or PEG35-enriched RLS. Liver injury, graft function, energy balance, autophagy, oxidative stress as well as inflammatory response were assessed. RESULTS: Flushing hepatic grafts with PEG35-enriched RLS resulted in decreased transaminase levels after cold ischemia. The improved graft function was evidenced by increased bile flow, enhanced BSP clearance, and reduced vascular resistance in these flushed grafts. Phospho-AMPK protein expression, as well as LC3B gene and protein expression were significantly increased compared to those unflushed and flushed only with RLS. PEG35-enriched RLS also maintained the oxidative state, as indicated by reduced activities of antioxidant enzymes and decreased MDA concentration. Additionally, this graft rinse solution down-regulated the inflammatory response by inhibiting the expression of genes involved in the HMGB-1/NF-κB/TNF-α signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: These data strongly suggest that rinsing liver grafts with PEG35-enriched RLS prior to reperfusion represents a simple and cost-effective strategy to enhance liver functional recovery after cold IR injury. This approach could serve as a viable alternative to RLS in clinical applications, highlighting the need for further research to explore its broader implications.","Jeddou, I. B.; Zaouali, M.

Previous research has focused on caregivers' negative feelings (e.g., caregiver burden). However, studies on caregivers' positive feelings are scarce. PURPOSE: The aim of the study is to assess the impact of social support on benefit finding and explore the potential mediating role of hope in this association in the caregivers of children receiving liver transplants. DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional design was conducted. Four hundred and seventeen caregivers of pediatric patients undergoing liver transplantation were recruited using convenience sampling, and the revised Chinese version of the Benefit Finding Scale (BFS-RC), Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS), and Herth Hope Index (HHI) were employed for evaluation. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis and Spearman's correlation coefficient evaluated influencing variables and the structural equation modeling was employed for testing the proposed mediation model. RESULTS: Results demonstrated favorable correlations among caregivers between benefit finding, hope, and social support. Social support and hope accounted for 14.3 % and 23.7 % of incremental variations in benefit finding, respectively. Furthermore, hope partially mediated the association between social support and benefit finding. CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the predictive role of social support and hope in benefit finding among caregivers of pediatric liver transplant recipients. Furthermore, hope partially mediated the link between social support and benefit finding. Therefore, interventions targeting enhanced social support and hope may bolster benefit finding among this caregiver population. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: These findings underscore the significance of social support and hope in fostering benefit finding among caregivers. Healthcare professionals can employ interventions to bolster social support and hope, thereby enhancing caregiver well-being and resilience. Integrating such strategies into clinical practice can better support caregivers navigating pediatric liver transplantation challenges.","Jiang, Y.; Hu, N.; Chang, T.",2025,J Pediatr Nurs,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Resveratrol, a mild natural polyphenol, is investigated here as a representative compound. Rat donor livers were subjected to 30 min of asystolic warm ischemia (DCD), followed by 2 h of either static cold storage (SCS), subnormothermic machine perfusion (SNMP) at 25 °C, or SNMP supplemented with resveratrol (SNMP-RES). All livers were subsequently reperfused under normothermic conditions for 1 h (NMP) with donor blood. Biochemical, transcriptomics RNA sequencing, inflammatory, and histological analyses were performed on perfusate samples and liver tissue biopsies. Resveratrol significantly enhanced the protective effects of SNMP, reducing perfusate AST (p = 0.03) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN) (p = 0.01). Resveratrol also decreased perfusate cytokine levels and improved tissue morphology. Transcriptomic analysis identified an upregulation of regenerative pathways using resveratrol, including Notch-signaling and Wnt signaling. The innate immune response was downregulated. This study represents the potential of FMN as a marker for liver quality during SNMP for the first time and demonstrates resveratrol's effects during SNMP. These findings encourage further exploration of mitochondrial-targeted preservation strategies and validate long-term benefits.","Jiao, C.; Li, M.; Sun, X.; Yeh, H.; Schlegel, A.; Lv, G.",2025,Sci Rep,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, newer portable ex vivo organ perfusion (PEVOP) strategies allow warm organ perfusion during transport. Although PEVOP is a complex process requiring additional staffing resources, few publications address the staffing requirements for this technology. To clarify this issue, we surveyed all 35 United States institutions with PEVOP programs in 2020 and again in 2025 about organization, staffing, and training. We achieved a 100% response rate in both years. The number of institutions with active PEVOP programs decreased from 35 in 2020 to 31 in 2025, while the number of organ platforms increased from 52 to 56. The proportion of platforms operated by manufacturers surged from 17.3% to 96.4% ( p < 0.00001), while the percentage run by physicians dropped from 51.9% to 6.7% ( p = 0.00174). Challenges to adequate PEVOP staffing, including administrative and financial burdens, as well as staff reluctance, remained consistent across surveys and were significant barriers to its use. These findings may assist institutions in developing strategies to meet the future needs of the workforce while maximizing the safe and effective use of this innovative technology.","Johnson, B.; Riley, W.; Arcaro, M.; Iwai, K.; Nordgren, R.; Madariaga, M.

455,,10.1097/TXD.0000000000001701,Successful Resuscitation of Porcine Hearts After 12 and 24 h of Static Cold Storage With Normothermic Ex Situ Perfusion,"Background. Heart transplantation is always an emergency because the transplant needs to occur within 6 h after procurement to prevent primary graft dysfunction. Static cold storage (SCS) is the gold-standard preservation method. This study describes the outcomes of hearts preserved after prolonged SCS (12 and 24 h); those are then resuscitated with a novel normothermic ex situ heart perfusion (NEHP) system., Methods. Anesthetized piglets (n = 10) were used as heart donors. Hearts were procured and stored at 5 [degrees]C CoStorSol following standard SCS protocols. Two groups were studied: SCS-12 h and SCS-24 h. After SCS, 8 h of NEHP (37 [degrees]C blood-based perfusate) was performed at 0.7-1.0 mL/min/g of cardiac tissue. NEHP parameters were monitored continuously. Results were corroborated with 3 additional hearts transplanted orthotopically in healthy recipients (n = 3) after SCS (24 h) + NEHP (5 h). Recipients were observed for 90 min after weaning off cardiopulmonary bypass support., Results. All hearts (after 12 and 24 h of SCS) regained normal function and metabolism within 10 min and retained it throughout 8 h of NEHP. No differences were observed in NEHP parameters and histopathology between groups. Three hearts were successfully transplanted after a total ~30 h of preservation (24 h of SCS + 5 h of NEHP + 1 h of second cold ischemia time). The 3 recipients were weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass with mild vasopressor support., Conclusions. NEHP has the potential to routinely resuscitate porcine hearts that have undergone SCS for up to 24 h, restoring them to viable function. By objectively assessing heart function before transplant, NEHP may enhance the success rate of transplants. If these resuscitated hearts can be successfully transplanted, it would support the effectiveness of NEHP in ensuring heart viability., (C) 2024 The Authors.

Feasibility of a protocol utilizing machine perfusion,"Despite European colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) transplant trials having been performed entirely using deceased donor liver transplant (DDLT), there has been speculation about whether similar results can be achieved in the United States, given the lack of MELD score prioritization. A formal transplant protocol for unresectable CRLM was implemented in our center at the start of 2022 with the plan to utilize DDLT. Between 2022 and 2025, 86 patients with CRLM were referred to our program, and 19 patients underwent a formal transplant evaluation. Median time from listing until transplant was 31 days (range 3-115 d). Median allocation MELD was 8 (range 6-15). The donor livers were from DCDs, older donors, or National Share livers, which had been declined by all other centers. All but 2 of the cases underwent advanced perfusion. There were no cases of primary nonfunction, postreperfusion syndrome, acute kidney injury, hepatic artery thrombosis, or ischemic cholangiopathy. The length of stay for the median posttransplant was 5 days. Graft and patient survival were 100% at the time of maximal follow-up. Recurrence developed in 3 recipients (25.0%), 1 of whom was treated and has no evidence of disease. These findings support the viability of DDLT for CRLM using advanced perfusion, contingent on strict protocol adherence. Center-specific waitlist dynamics must inform the choice between DDLT and living donor liver transplant (LDLT).","Jones, J.; Taner, C.

It also provides fertile soil for tumor metastases, which tend to be more resistant to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy than metastases in other organs. This resistance may result from the sum of incremental evolutionary adaptions in various cell types to prevent overaction to antigens absorbed from the gut into the portal circulation or it might involve a central mechanism. Here, we propose that metabolism of vitamin A, which is highly concentrated in the liver, is a root source of tolerance and resistance of hepatic metastases to checkpoint blockade. Suppression of retinoic acid synthesis from vitamin A with disulfiram may mitigate tolerance and produce enhanced immunotherapy treatment results for patients with liver metastases.","Jones, P.

Using US transplant registry data, we evaluated geographic differences in utilization by donor quality, policy era, and uptake of advanced perfusion (AP). This retrospective cohort included all liver donors and waitlisted patients from 2010 to September 2024. Donors were aggregated by Hospital Referral Region (HRR) and stratified by quality using the liver Discard Risk Index (DSRI). Exposures included the allocation policy era and increased use of AP technology (July 2022 onward). Observed-to-expected (O:E) ratios of liver non-utilization were calculated by HRR and modeled to reveal geographically contiguous low utilization clusters (LUCs). The proportion of HRRs within LUCs increased from 24% in Share 15 (S15), to 25% in Share 35 (S35), 32% in Acuity Circles (AC), and then decreased to 21% in the AP era ( p =0.01). There were 7 distinct LUCs in S15 (median non-utilization=33%), 7 LUCs in S35 (non-utilization=32%), 7 LUCs in AC (non-utilization=41%), and 3 LUCs in the AP era (non-utilization=46%). Donor quality by HRR decreased over time, with a median DSRI of 2.56 (IQR: 1.25-5.79) in S15 to 5.69 (2.01-35.30) in AP ( p <0.001). Accounting for DSRI, odds of non-utilization were highest in AC ( ref. Share 35 , OR=1.27, p <0.001), which decreased in AP (OR=1.06, p =0.001). Utilization of normothermic machine perfusion was associated with a markedly lower odds of discard (OR=0.03, 0.03-0.04; p <0.001). Livers originating from LUCs traveled shorter distances in each era other than S35. The number of net exporter HRRs in LUCs was equivalent to non-LUCs in each era, other than AP, where LUCs contained fewer net exporter HRRs [2 (3.2%) vs. 42 (17.4%), p =0.004]. On adjusted analysis, candidates in LUCs had a lower likelihood of transplant (HR=0.88, p <0.001) but also lower waitlist mortality (HR=0.95, p <0.001). The advent of advanced perfusion was associated with the utilization of otherwise marginal liver allografts and ameliorating geographic imbalances in discard seen with successive allocation policy eras.","Jones-Carr, M.

418,,10.21037/acs-2024-dcd-0074,Australian outcomes from heart transplantation in the machine perfusion era,"Background: In the current era of heart transplantation, machine perfusion strategies are emerging as potential additions to the armamentarium of a transplant unit. Donation after circulatory death (DCD) donor hearts assessed through normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) has helped expand the donor pool. Hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) is emerging as an alternative strategy to traditional static cold storage (SCS) when a prolonged ischemic time is anticipated in brain dead (BD) donors, this is important in Australia where long distant procurement is vital. In this study we examine the outcomes in our unit where both forms of machine perfusion (NMP and HMP), as well as SCS is utilized for donor heart preservation, with a particular focus on severe primary graft dysfunction (sPGD) and mortality., Methods: The year 2021 represents the year when both forms of machine perfusion were available to our unit. Heart transplants in our unit from January 2021 to February 2024 were categorized into three groups for retrospective analysis: (I) DCD-NMP group (n=44); (II) BD-HMP group (n=38), and (III) BD-SCS group (n=78)., Results: There were no significant differences in the mean donor and recipient ages between the three groups. Donor preservation time in the BD-HMP group was significantly longer than the donor ischemic time in the BD-SCS group, and organ care system (OCS) run time in the DCD-NMP group (361+/-89 vs. 208+/-47 and 249+/-49 min respectively, P<0.001). For DCD-NMP, BD-HMP and BD-SCS groups respectively: 30-day survival was: 100%, 97% and 100%; 1-year survival was: 94%, 90% and 94%; 2-year survival was: 90%, 90% and 89% (P=0.9). There was no significant difference in the incidence of sPGD between the three groups (DCD-NMP: 7%, BD-HMP: 5%, and BD-SCS: 5%, P=0.9), Conclusions: Machine perfusion strategies represent important additions to the modern transplant unit and can expand the donor pool.

49,40351089.0,10.1002/jpn3.70065,Update on pediatric liver transplantation in Europe 2022: An ELITA-ESPGHAN report,"OBJECTIVES: The European Liver Transplant Registry (ELTR) has been collecting data on liver transplantation (LT) in Europe since 1968. The aim of this report is to outline the number, techniques utilized, indications for, and outcomes of pediatric LT (pLT) in Europe, focusing on the Year 2022 in comparison to the preceding 5 years. METHODS: Data were obtained from ELTR and Eurotransplant (ET). Summary statistics were performed. RESULTS: In 2022, 585 pLTs were performed in Europe. The annual number of pLT decreased for the third consecutive year. Living donor LT represented 34% (n = 201) of pLT. The proportion of living donation (LD) remained stable over time. The major indication for pLT in Europe is biliary atresia. Donor age is increasing overall and is associated with worse graft survival. Graft and patient survival were impacted by both types of donors and types of grafts, and were significantly worse after re-transplantation. Most graft failures (77%) and deaths (82%) occurred within the first 6 months after pLT. CONCLUSION: Annual numbers of pLT in Europe are decreasing over time. Given that the proportion of LD has remained stable, the shortage of deceased donor organs may not be the major reason for this trend, and other factors play a role. A focus on improving perioperative care is needed because the risk of graft loss and mortality is highest in the first 6 months after transplantation. New techniques like ex-situ machine perfusion may help mitigate risks with declining quality of deceased donor liver grafts.","Junge, N.; Karam, V.; Hartog, H.; Adam, R.; Cailliez, V.; Indolfi, G.; Samyn, M.; Stephenne, X.; Pop, T.

There is a need to carefully analyze the recent outcome data from across the globe and from large volume North American centers that clearly establishes the benefit of Living donor transplants for both adults and children and reducing wait list mortality. LDLT also provides an opportunity for expanding the indications to offer transplant for indications like colorectal metastasis and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma without reducing the number of livers available for traditional indications. Recent expansion of perfusion technology has demonstrated significant increase in utilization of Non heart beating donor livers over the last few years. However, with simultaneous increase in patients being added to the wait list, the wait list mortality and dropouts have been persistently high. In this opinion piece, the authors have looked at the transplant trends in the US in the last few years and advocate for adopting a complementary rather than a singular approach for expansion of LDLT along with new perfusion technologies for increasing the number of liver transplants in the US.","Kapoor, S.; Desai, C.

This review demonstrated the historical milestones of pediatric organ transplantation, emphasizing Japan's contributions, mainly through the National Center for Child Health and Development. While early transplantation efforts in the 1950s and 1960s faced significant challenges, breakthroughs in preservation methods, immunosuppressive therapies, surgical techniques, and innovations such as living donor LT in Asia have greatly improved success rates. Japan's pediatric LT landscape is distinct, primarily due to its reliance on living donor LT, shaped by cultural and religious influences that have traditionally restricted deceased donor organ donation. This review manuscript discusses Japan's pioneering role in expanding the indications for pediatric LT to include rare conditions such as inherited metabolic disorders and hepatoblastoma. It highlights recent innovations such as hyper-reduced lateral segment grafts, machine perfusion, and minimally invasive surgery that have further improved outcomes. International collaboration has facilitated the sharing of expertise, advancing pediatric liver transplantation practice worldwide. Despite these achievements, challenges remain, particularly in light of Japan's declining birth rate, which threatens the sustainability of pediatric transplant services. This review emphasizes the need for centralized transplant facilities, greater awareness of brain-dead organ donation, and continued medical advances to ensure that pediatric LT remains a viable, life-saving option for future generations.","Kasahara, M.; Sakamoto, S.",2025,Chin Med J (Engl),Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vaccination is an important preventive measure but may have side effects, including decreased leukocyte counts. We aimed to describe the prevalence and relative incidence of decreased leukocyte counts and changes in leukocyte counts before and after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection in SOT recipients. METHODS: Changes in leukocyte counts from before to after each vaccine dose were investigated using linear mixed models. We determined the prevalence of decreased leukocyte counts before and after each vaccine dose and before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Self-controlled case series analysis was used to investigate whether the period after either vaccination or infection was associated with risk of decreased leukocyte count. RESULTS: We included 228 adult kidney, lung, and liver transplant recipients. Prior to the first vaccine dose, the mean leukocyte count was 7.3 × 10(9) cells/L (95% CI 6.9-7.6). Both the leukocyte counts, and the prevalence of decreased leukocyte counts remained unchanged from before to after vaccination regardless of the number of vaccine doses provided. There was no association between vaccination and decreased leukocyte counts (incidence rate ratio (IRR): 0.6; 95% CI: 0.2-2.1; p = 0.461). In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with increased risk of a decreased leukocyte count (IRR: 7.1; 95% CI: 2.8-18.1; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination was not associated with risk of decreased leukocyte count and did not affect the prevalence of decreased leukocyte counts in SOT recipients. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a higher risk of a decreased leukocyte count.","Kern, M.; Hamm, S. R.; Pedersen, C. R.; Møller, D. L.; Loft, J. A.; Hasselbalch, R.

Mechanisms underlying improved NMP restoration of donation after brain death (DBD) and donation after circulatory death (DCD) livers remain incompletely defined. We tested the hypothesis that NMP would decrease transcripts encoding inflammatory mediators following both perfusion and transplant of DBD and DCD livers. Biopsy transcript expression profiles were determined from SCS DBD livers at pre-SCS preservation and transplant reperfusion and from benchmark and outside benchmark criteria DBD and DCD livers pre-NMP, after 6-7 h of NMP, and after transplant reperfusion. Compared to SCS livers, NMP programs converged transcript profiles of DCD and DBD livers, decreasing transplant reperfusion-induced inflammatory transcripts while increasing transcripts promoting wound healing and tissue repair processes, but did not obviate the high occurrence of adverse events in the outside benchmark DCD livers transplants.","Keslar, K.

It predominantly affects women during the fifth and sixth decades. Treatment options have progressed from ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and obeticholic acid (OCA) to liver and stem cell transplant. The objectives include summarizing established and new diagnostic approaches for PBC along with reviewing efficacy treatments, their side effects, and future directions. The treatment of PBC is based on risk stratification, including assessment of the patient's age, sex, clinical pattern, biochemical and antibody profile, histology, and markers of fibrosis. UDCA and OCA are Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved first-line and second-line agents. Elafibranor, a recently FDA-approved agent based on its efficacy, was shown in the ELATIVE trial. Seladelpar, currently under FDA review in the ENHANCE III trial, is also used in PBC. Fibrates, a third-line treatment, are found efficacious in different trials. Other treatment options are in phase II/III clinical trials. The question of whether we use immunotherapy has been answered in the NCT02376335 and NCT00746486 trials, stating that rituximab and budesonide cannot be used as no clinical significance is observed. The emergence of new therapies and the potential of combination treatments offer hope for improving outcomes for all patients with PBC. Personalized treatment strategies, continuous monitoring, and a comprehensive approach to symptom management are key to optimizing care and enhancing the quality of life for individuals affected by this chronic liver disease.","Khan, A.

Kidney transplant recipients, due to long-term immunosuppressive therapy, have an increased risk of developing malignancies, including NHL. PATIENT CONCERNS: A post-kidney transplantation patient presented with lower extremity symptoms. Initial lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging suggested foraminal stenosis and disc herniation. However, persistent symptoms and lack of clinical improvement prompted further investigation. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a retroperitoneal mass compressing the iliac vessels. Biopsy confirmed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. DIAGNOSES: Abdominal computed tomography showed multiple hepatic nodules, ascites, and right pleural effusion, consistent with systemic involvement of NHL. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with R-CHOP chemotherapy, the standard regimen for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. OUTCOMES: The patient demonstrated a favorable response to chemotherapy, with symptomatic improvement and a reduction in the retroperitoneal mass size. Continued follow-up emphasized supportive management and oncologic surveillance. LESSONS: This case highlights the need for a broad differential diagnosis in posttransplant patients with common musculoskeletal complaints. Early consideration of malignancy is crucial to avoid delayed diagnosis and optimize outcomes.","Kim, J.; Kwon, S. Y.",2025,Medicine (Baltimore),Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While its potential to improve graft preservation is clear, several challenges hinder routine adoption: High costs, logistical complexity, lack of standardized viability criteria, limited long-term outcome data, and absence of direct comparisons between hypothermic and normothermic MP. From my experience of over 900 liver transplants without MP, and the limited uptake among Korean centers, compelling evidence for its necessity remains lacking. The immunomodulatory effects of MP, particularly in ABO-incompatible or sensitized recipients, remain underexplored. Future research should integrate immune profiling, mechanistic analyses, and biomarker-guided immunosuppression strategies into multicenter trials to clarify its role in tolerance induction and long-term graft protection. Ethical, regulatory, and policy considerations especially in resource-limited settings must also be addressed to ensure equitable access. Robust clinical and mechanistic data are essential before MP can be fully endorsed as standard care.","Kim, S. H.",2025,World J Gastroenterol,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Surgical resection/transplantation offers the only hope for cure; however, many patients are not candidates and have limited therapeutic options. Opioid growth factor (OGF) is a naturally occurring bioactive endogenous pentapeptide that inhibits growth of human HCC cell lines in vitro by a receptor-mediated mechanism and inhibits progression of tumors in nude mice. Based on these preclinical studies, we conducted a phase I clinical trial with dose escalation (standard 3 + 3 protocol) of OGF to determine the maximum tolerated dose in HCC patients with concomitant liver disease (NCT00706576). Fifteen doses were administered to 14 patients with a maximum 300 µg/kg dose. No Grade 3 toxicities were encountered in the study group. This dose exceeds the maximum tolerated dose reached in our previous phase I pancreatic cancer trial. We conclude that OGF can be safely administered to patients with HCC and concomitant liver disease without significant toxicities up to a dose of 300 µg/kg. The result of this trial provides data on toxicity and the pharmacokinetics of OGF in patients with HCC and liver disease and lays the groundwork for additional studies.","Kimchi, E. T.; Kaifi, J.

A brain-dead donor's liver was split under continuous DHOPE, followed by simultaneous transplantation into two adult recipients. Results: Both recipients exhibited stable graft function at one-year follow-up. DHOPE effectively reduced CIT and optimized postoperative recovery, with no major complications beyond Clavien-Dindo Grade IIIb.

The samples were analyzed to quantify and characterize immune cells, assessing the effectiveness of HOPE in reducing cellular debris and its impact on graft quality. Results: The primary perfusate contained significant concentrations of immune cells, mainly segmented neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes. After 10 min of perfusion, outflow cell concentration decreased by over 95%, and by the end of perfusion, a more than 99% reduction was observed. Conclusions: HOPE effectively reduces immune cell concentrations in liver grafts, suggesting a mechanism for improved graft function and reduced post-transplant complications. These findings support the continued use and optimization of HOPE in LTx.","Koch, D. T.; Schirren, M.; Jacobi, S.; Nieß, H.; Renz, B. W.; Werner, J.; Guba, M.

This study compares early posttransplant outcomes of mono-HOPE (portal vein perfusion only) versus dual- HOPE (both portal vein and hepatic artery perfusion). A retrospective analysis was conducted on 183 LiTx recipients, with 90 receiving mono-HOPE and 93 receiving dual-HOPE grafts. Propensity Score Matching (PSM) was applied, resulting in a matched cohort of 146 patients. Primary outcomes included one-year patient and graft survival, and non-anastomotic biliary strictures (NAS). Secondary outcomes included hospital length of stay (HLS). One-year patient survival was 81.7% in the mono-HOPE and 81.7% in the dual-HOPE group, and overall survival did not differ (p = 0.990). One-year death-censored graft survival was similarly comparable (91.2% vs. 93.3%, p = 0.893). NAS were observed in 10.96% in the mono-HOPE and 8.22% in the dual-HOPE group (p = 0.574). The median HLS was 29 days for both groups. Results suggest that dual-HOPE did not significantly improve patient or graft survival, nor did it reduce NAS or HLS compared to mono-HOPE. Assuming that larger cohorts and long-term follow-up data confirm this, additional cannulation of the hepatic artery during machine perfusion in hypothermic conditions may not be beneficial.","Koch, D.

360,40999663.0,10.12659/ajcr.948652,Diagnostic Challenges in Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma in a Young Liver Transplant Patient with Ulcerative Colitis: A Case Report,"BACKGROUND Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common form of malignant lymphoma. The hypothesis that age-related immune decline plays a role in the development of lymphoma is well established and exemplified by the association between Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and DLBCL. This report describes a 22-year-old liver transplant patient with ulcerative colitis (UC) presenting with ileus and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Because of the symptoms, an exacerbation of UC was initially suggested, which contributed to a delay in definitive diagnosis. CASE REPORT A 22-year-old patient with a medical history of ulcerative colitis, liver transplantation, and use of immunosuppressive drugs presented gradually progressive abdominal pain, bloating, and, eventually, lack of bowel movements. Initially, abdominal X-ray revealed the presence of radiological features consistent with sub-ileus/ileus. Then, the serological tests for EBV in the IgG class yielded positive results. Subsequently, the contrast-enhanced abdominal and pelvic computed tomography (CT) scans revealed the presence of enlarged lymph nodes forming a conglomerate. A percutaneous thick-needle biopsy of a conglomerate of lymph nodes in the abdominal cavity was performed, which revealed DLBCL. After diagnosis, the patient underwent 6 cycles of R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone) chemotherapy, achieving remission. CONCLUSIONS This case report emphasizes that clinicians need to consider the risk of oncogenesis associated with the prolonged use of immunosuppressive agents and EBV-seropositive infection status. Screening for EBV before initiating immunosuppressive therapy should be compulsory. EBV-negative patients on immunosuppression must especially avoid EBV infection, while EBV-positive patients must be monitored more closely due to higher oncological risk.","Kopoń, M.; Wileńska, A.; Zdrenka, M.; Szylberg, Ł; Koza, J.",2025,Am J Case Rep,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND: NLMP is emerging as a clinical routine in LT and has recently received renewed attention; however, outcomes outside of clinical trials are lacking. METHODS: All adult LT between February 2018 and January 2023 were included. A comprehensive viability assessment was applied during NLMP. Outcomes were compared between NLMP and SCS recipients, as well as benchmark and non-benchmark cases. RESULTS: Of the 332 LT included, 174 underwent NLMP and 158 were transplanted after SCS. Sixty-seven organs were accepted and transplanted only under the premise of NLMP. One-year graft survival for SCS and NLMP recipients was 83.8% versus 81.3% and 93.4% for benchmark cases in the overall cohort. Total preservation time had no influence on graft survival in the NLMP group but was associated with inferior 1-year graft survival in the SCS group. NLMP usage increased significantly over the duration of the study period, as did the median total preservation time. With increasing NLMP use and longer preservation times, nighttime surgery decreased significantly from 41.9% to 4.2%.

Machine perfusion technologies, including normothermic machine perfusion (NMP), hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE), and normothermic regional perfusion (NRP) have demonstrated great promise in optimizing graft quality, mitigating ischemia-reperfusion injury, and enhancing the use of marginal and DCD liver grafts. At this year's congress a total of 63 abstracts on liver machine perfusion were presented. For this report we selected all orally presented abstracts highlighting advances in organ preservation, artificial intelligence, treatments during ex-situ perfusion including cellular therapy as well as new the use of new biomarkers. Preclinical highlights included the potential of long-term NMP to sustain and regenerate grafts during extended ex-situ preservation, spontaneous defatting of steatotic grafts during LT-NMP, the delivery of regulatory T cells to enable organ-level immunomodulation and the removal of damage-associated molecular patterns from porcine DCD livers during NMP. On the clinical side, key points included the progression of HOPE to IDEAL-D Stage 4 evidence, increased transplant volumes through the application of NMP, the cost-effectiveness of NMP as well as the utilization of very old DCD donors through NRP. Collectively, these advancements mark a transition toward dynamic, data-driven, and personalized transplantation strategies.

Therefore, the search for even more precise and individualized therapies is ongoing and preclinical tumor models are central to the development of such new approaches. AREAS COVERED: The models described in the current review include simple and advanced in vitro and in vivo models, including cell lines, 2D monolayer, spheroid and organoid cultures, 3D bioprinting, patient-derived xenografts, and more recently, machine-perfusion platform-based models of resected liver specimens. All these models have individual advantages, disadvantages and limitations that need to be considered depending on the desired application. EXPERT OPINION: In addition to potential cost limitations, availability of BTC cell types, time required for model establishment and growth success rate, the individual models differently reflect relevant characteristics such as tumor heterogeneity, spatial tumor-stroma microenvironment interactions, metabolic and nutritional gradients and immunological interactions. Therefore, a consequent combination of different models may be required to improve clinical study outcomes by strengthening the preclinical data basis.","Krendl, F.

The standard heart-then-liver approach may increase ischemic times and postreperfusion syndrome (PRS) risk. Achieving adequate hemodynamic stability may also pose a challenge. To mitigate these risks, we assessed the use of liver normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) in a staged CHLT.

Subsequent liver biopsy found end-stage cirrhosis. He was bridged with an Impella 5.5 until a dual heart-liver donor became available. A standard heart transplant via redo sternotomy was performed on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The chest was packed but left open in anticipation of the liver transplant. The liver was placed on NMP using the Organ Care System (TransMedics) with hepatic arterial and portal venous flows set at 350 and 0.8 mL/min, respectively. He received a staged liver transplant using the standard 'piggyback' technique, 8 h after the heart transplant. There was minimal PRS and bleeding. Total time on NMP was 16.4 h. The chest and abdomen were closed at the end of the liver transplant. The postoperative course was complicated by acute renal failure requiring temporary hemodialysis. He was eventually discharged home, is now off dialysis, and continues to do well. Summary: The NMP keeps the liver in an active metabolic state, allowing us to transplant the heart and establish optimal hemostasis to decrease blood product transfusion. This also allows time for proper postoperative fluid resuscitation and lactic acidosis clearance and helps achieve better hemodynamic stability with decreased inotrope/vasopressor doses. Additionally, the liver NMP is effective in minimizing complications related to PRS. A staged approach to CHLT using the NMP should be considered in such high-risk patients.","Kwon, Y. I.

6,39947804.0,10.1016/j.ajt.2025.01.022,OPTN/SRTR 2023 Annual Data Report: Liver,"The number of liver transplants performed in 2023 in the United States reached another record high, totaling 10,659 overall, of which 10,125 (95.0%) were in adult recipients and 534 (5.0%) were in pediatric recipients. This growth was driven by increased recovery of livers from older donors and donation after circulatory death (DCD) donors-likely related to the wider availability of machine perfusion technologies. The overall nonuse rate, or percent of livers recovered for transplant and not transplanted, was 9.7%, a decrease from the preceding years, and 16.7% of transplant recipients accepted DCD livers. There was also growth in living donation, representing 5.7% of adult transplants and 14.6% of pediatric transplants. In July 2023, the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) 3.0 and pediatric end-stage liver disease (PELD)-creatinine scoring systems were updated from MELD-sodium and PELD, respectively, and criteria for status 1B qualification for pediatric candidates were updated. A major goal of MELD 3.0 was to address the sex disparity in deceased donor transplant rates. In 2023, the gap in deceased donor liver transplant rates between sexes narrowed, although the rate remained higher for adult male candidates compared with female candidates, and pretransplant mortality rates were higher among adult female candidates compared with male candidates. Alcohol-associated liver disease and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis remained the leading indications for liver transplant.","Kwong, A. J.; Kim, W. R.; Lake, J. R.; Schladt, D.

Ex-situ normothermic machine perfusion (ESNMP) has emerged as a potential strategy to mitigate ischemic injury. However, the effect of ESNMP on reducing post-LT IC remains controversial. This study aimed to perform an updated meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of ESNMP on IC incidence. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted following PRISMA guidelines. The literature search included studies from 2015 to 2025 comparing LT outcomes using ESNMP vs. static cold storage (SCS). The primary outcome was the incidence of IC. Risk of bias was assessed using the ROBINS-E tool. Statistical analysis, including random-effects meta-analysis, sensitivity analysis, and meta-regression, was performed to evaluate heterogeneity, potential confounders, and the impact of follow-up duration. RESULTS: Seventeen studies, including 76,045 patients (4843 ESNMP; 71,202 SCS), were analyzed. No statistically significant difference in IC incidence was found between ESNMP and SCS (1.3 % vs. 0.6 %; RR = 0.68, 95 %CI = 0.41-1.13; P = 0.14). Sensitivity analysis excluding one outlier study revealed a reduction in IC risk with ESNMP (RR = 0.62, 95 %CI = 0.38-1.01; P = 0.054). Two sub-analyses of studies with ≥12 months of follow-up (RR = 0.51, 95 %CI = 0.26-0.99; P = 0.049) and DCDs (RR = 0.33, 95 %CI = 0.16-0.67; P = 0.002) showed risk reduction. The meta-regression revealed that the back-to-base perfusion approach was associated with the occurrence of IC, with an OR of 1.03 (95 %CI = 1.00-1.07, P = 0.035). CONCLUSIONS: a correlation between ESNMP use and IC reduced risk appears to exist, especially with longer follow-up periods and DCDs, though more high-quality studies are needed to confirm this finding.","Lai, Q.; Angelico, R.; Guglielmo, N.; Pagano, D.; Martins, P.

331,39801755.0,10.1002/btm2.10724,A novel cytoprotective organ perfusion platform for reconstructing homeostasis of DCD liver while alleviating IRI injury,"Pump is a vital component for expelling the perfusate in small animal isolated organ normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) systems whose flexible structure and rhythmic contraction play a crucial role in maintaining perfusion system homeostasis. However, the continuous extrusion forming with the rigid stationary shaft of the peristaltic pumps can damage cells, leading to metabolic disorders and eventual dysfunction of transplanted organs. Here, we developed a novel biomimetic blood-gas system (BBGs) for preventing cell damage. This system mimics the cardiac cycle and features an adjustable inspiratory-to-expiratory (IE) ratio to mitigate acidosis caused by continuous oxygen inhalation. In our study, adipose stem cells (ADSCs) were cultured within the circulatory system for 10 min, 2, and 4 h. Compared to the peristaltic pump, the BBGs significantly reduced cell apoptosis and morphological injury while enhancing cell proliferation and adhesion. Additionally, when the supernatant from ADSCs was introduced to LPS-induced macrophages for 24 h, the BBGs group demonstrated a more pronounced anti-inflammatory effect, characterized by reduced M1 macrophage expression. Besides, with isolated rat livers from donation after circulatory death (DCD) perfusion with ADSCs for 6 h by the BBGs, we detected fewer apoptotic cells and a reduced inflammatory response, evidenced by down-regulated TNF-α expression. The development of BBGs demonstrates the feasibility of recreating physiological liquid-gas circulation in vitro, offering an alternative platform for isolated organ perfusion, especially for applications involving cell therapy.","Lan, T.; Yu, M.; Ming, T.; Wang, H.; Deng, J.; Cheng, S.; Shen, Z.; Kong, D.",2025,Bioeng Transl Med,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

120,39737605.0,10.1111/aor.14939,Perfusion Pressures and Weight Loss During Normothermic Machine Perfusion of Human Donor Livers,"BACKGROUND: Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) is increasingly used to preserve and assess donor livers prior to transplantation. Due to its success, it is expected that more centers will start using this technology. However, NMP may also cause adverse effects. METHODS: In this retrospective, observational study, we investigated the effect of NMP pressures on donor liver weight, post-transplant outcomes, and hepatic perfusion characteristics. A total of 36 livers were transplanted after NMP. NMP perfusion pressure settings were lowered from a median (IQR) of 47 mmHg (42-54) to 34 mmHg (30-39) for the hepatic artery (HA), and from 8 mmHg (7-10) to 7 mmHg (6-8) for the portal vein (PV) to diminish potential edema formation inside the liver. RESULTS: This change appeared to lead to a reduction of liver weight after NMP (-22 g to -143 g, p = 0.02), without affecting the PV flow velocity (35.5 to 48.0 cm/s, p = 0.54), or hepatocellular injury markers during NMP (AST 1511-1148 U/L, p = 0.44; ALT 318-849 U/L, p = 0.35), and post-transplantation outcomes. Changes in liver weight correlated significantly with the applied PV pressure during NMP (r = 0.52, p < 0.01) and the HA flow (r = 0.38, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: NMP can lead to a reduction in liver weight, which might be masked by edema when high perfusion pressures are used. We encourage applying the lowest perfusion pressures possible to reach adequate flows and oxygen supply during liver NMP.","Lascaris, B.; Bodewes, S. B.; Thorne, A. M.; van den Heuvel, M.

Long-term NMP (LT-NMP; ≥24 h) is emerging as a method to improve or repair livers initially deemed unsuitable for transplantation. This study investigated metabolism during LT-NMP, focusing on hepatic energy consumption and nitrogen and electrolyte balances to better understand long-term perfusion requirements. In this study, we measured oxygen consumption (V̇o(2)) and carbon dioxide production (V̇co(2)) to determine the energy expenditure of 14 human livers during LT-NMP for 7 days. In addition, hepatic balances of glucose and lactate as well as of nitrogen and electrolytes were determined. Initial high metabolic rates during the first day of LT-NMP decreased and stabilized at nearly 50% on day 3, suggesting a quiescent state until day 7. Most energy was derived from glucose (75%-88%). Continuous amino acid supplementation was essential to maintain an anabolic state, whereas livers without supplementation became catabolic. Although net electrolyte balances were close to zero, significant uptake and release of electrolytes occurred throughout LT-NMP. During LT-NMP, livers reached a metabolically quiescent state after 3 days with decreased energy consumption. Tailoring perfusate composition and supplementation protocols to the specific needs of the liver could enhance organ preservation and potentially expand the pool of viable donor livers after LT-NMP.NEW & NOTEWORTHY A long-term normothermic machine perfusion platform is being developed for repairing and regenerating damaged livers to make them suitable for transplantation. The energy expenditure and the metabolic needs of 14 human donor livers were observed during NMP for up to a week. We noticed that livers become metabolically quiescent after 3 days and that a change in our nutrimental support protocol might be necessary to provide a better environment for the livers during NMP.","Lascaris, B.; Woltjes, L.

454,,10.1097/TP.0000000000004653,Microbial Contamination During Long-term Ex Vivo Normothermic Machine Perfusion of Human Livers,"Background. Normothermic machine perfusion permits the ex vivo preservation of human livers before transplantation. Long-term perfusion for days-to-weeks provides the opportunity for enhanced pretransplant assessment and potential regeneration of organs. However, this risks microbial contamination and infection of the recipient if the organ is transplanted. An understanding of perfusate microbial contamination is required to inform infection control procedures and antimicrobial prophylaxis for this technology., Methods. We modified a liver perfusion machine for long-term use by adding long-term oxygenators and a dialysis filter. Human livers that were not suitable for transplantation were perfused using a red-cell-based perfusate under aseptic and normothermic conditions (36 [degrees]C) with a goal of 14 d. Cephazolin was added to the perfusate for antimicrobial prophylaxis. Perfusate and bile were sampled every 72 h for microbial culture., Results. Eighteen partial human livers (9 left lateral segment grafts and 9 extended right grafts) were perfused using our perfusion system. The median survival was 7.2 d. All organs surviving longer than 7 d (9/18) had negative perfusate cultures at 24 and 48 h. Half of the grafts (9/18) became culture-positive by the end of perfusion. Microbial contaminants included Gram-negative (Pseudomonas species, Proteus mirabilis, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) and Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Bacillus species) as well as yeast (Candida albicans)., Conclusions. Microbial contamination of perfusate is common during long-term perfusion of human livers with both exogenous and endogenous sources. Enhanced infection control practices and review of targeted antimicrobial prophylaxis are likely to be necessary for translation into the clinical arena., Copyright (C) 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

An 8-year experience,"BACKGROUND: Uncontrolled DCD (uDCD) represents a potential source of organs since the global survival rates of patients with out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is estimated less than 10% across all registries. We describe our 8-year experience with the implementation of the uDCD program over the Tuscany Region since June 2016. We focus on feasibility, results (organ transplant) and organizational changes. METHODS: The study population included uDCDs assessed in the Tuscany Region from 2016 to 2024. Two different periods were considered: Period 1: from 2016 to 2019; Period 2: from 2020 to 2024 (after COVID pandemic). RESULTS: Overall, 226 potential uDCDs were assessed by the local transplant coordinators, with an increased number in Period 2 in respect to Period 1 (151 vs. 75, 67% vs. 33%). A significant increase in refusals was observed (Period 2: 25% vs. Period 1: 6%, P=0.004). The overall utilization rate was 56%. Fifty-seven kidneys were transplanted, 22 livers and two lungs. The number of organs per donor increased in Period 2 compared to Period 1. CONCLUSIONS: According to our 8-year experience, the uDCD proved to be an add-on activity, giving the opportunity to all OHCA patients without survival options to save lives by organ donation. The uDCD only lung program is a feasible chance to organ donate for OHCA patients with no survival possibility in peripheral hospital. The uDCD program, despite its complexity, seems to have potentials ranging to organizational (uDCD only lung program, mobile machine perfusion) to clinical issues (optimizing the donor-recipient match).","Lazzeri, C.; Bonizzoli, M.; Ghinolfi, D.; Li Marzi, V.; Luzzi, L.; Entani Santini, L.; Peris, A.",2025,Minerva Anestesiol,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study evaluated the feasibility, long-term patency, complications, and survival rates of single-orifice hepatic venous outflow reconstruction using right lobe grafts. METHODS: A prospective study was conducted involving 52 patients who underwent LDLT with right lobe grafts at 108 Military Central Hospital, Vietnam, from January 2019 to December 2020, with follow-up extending until December 2024. The technique included forming a single triangular orifice by joining the middle hepatic vein (MHV) and right hepatic vein, utilizing extended right lobe grafts with the MHV or modified right lobe grafts where MHV reconstruction was performed using polytetrafluoroethylene grafts. Outcome measures included ultrasound, CT scans, and regular clinical follow-up. RESULTS: Ten patients (19.3%) required MHV reconstruction. Mean reconstruction time was 17.4 minutes; cold ischemic time averaged 40.9 ± 6.3 minutes. Intraoperative patency was achieved in all cases, with 96.2% showing complete graft perfusion. Five-year patency was 94.2%. MHV complications occurred in three patients (5.8%): two stenoses (3.8%, conservatively managed) and one fatal occlusion (1.9%). Anastomotic diameter ≤ 30 mm significantly increased complication risk (odds ratio [OR], 14.286; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.121-183.823; p = 0.011). Five-year survival was 84.6% (95% CI: 75.2%-93.9%), with rates of 100% for cirrhosis, 85.7% for hepatocellular carcinoma, and 58.8% for acute-on-chronic liver failure. CONCLUSIONS: Single-orifice hepatic venous outflow reconstruction is simple, efficient, and reliable in LDLT, achieving high long-term patency and low complication rates without cadaveric grafts.","Le, H.

Varieties of different MP protocols are available. Currently, various MP protocols are available, differing not only in perfusion temperature but also in the specific perfusion solution required. We aimed to investigate the performance of an HTK-based perfusate during sub-normothermic MP (SNMP) of discarded human liver grafts compared to that of a UW-based solution. Twenty discarded livers (rejected for transplantation by all centers) were subjected to ex-vivo SNMP at 21°C with either HTK- or UW-based solution for 12 h. Perfusate and tissue samples collected before the start, after 6 h, and at the end of SNMP were analyzed for liver enzymes, along with mRNA expression of perfusate and tissue markers associated with organ damage. Hepatocellular viability was assessed by measuring bile production, monitoring pH stability, and analyzing histological changes in HE stained tissue sections. After propensity score matching 16 livers were analyzed. Overall, no differences between HTK- and UW-based solution were detected, except for an increased MLKL mRNA expression and impaired pH stability during SNMP with HTK-based perfusate. No other investigated parameters of cell injury, inflammation or hepatocellular viability supported this finding. Bile production was higher in the 6 HTK-perfused livers compared to the three UW-perfused livers that produced bile. Overall, these findings suggest that HTK performs comparably to a UW-based solution during 12 h of liver SNMP.","Leber, B.; Stimmeder, S.; Briendl, K.; Weber, J.; Rohrhofer, L.; Aigelsreiter, A.; Niedrist, T.; Sucher, R.; Stiegler, P.",2025,Sci Rep,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present analysis aimed to investigate the impact of prolonged time from cross-clamp until NMP start on early allograft dysfunction and other peri-liver transplant (LT) outcomes. All DCD LT performed and placed on NMP at Mayo Clinic Arizona, Florida, and Rochester from January 2022 to March 2024 were included. The decision was made a priori to divide the population into 2 groups based on terciles: typical cross-clamp to on-pump time (lower 2 terciles) versus prolonged cross-clamp to on-pump time (upper tercile; >2 h 45.6 min). Three hundred eighty-four DCD LT undergoing NMP met the inclusion criteria. The rate of early allograft dysfunction was significantly higher in the prolonged cross-clamp to on-pump group (51.2%) compared to the typical cross-clamp to on-pump group (37.6%) ( p = 0.01). The prolonged cross-clamp to on-pump group also had higher rates of acute kidney injury and the number of packed red blood cells transfused during LT. No significant difference in ischemic cholangiopathy (2.4% vs. 3.1%; p = 0.68) or graft survival at 12 months was seen between the prolonged cross-clamp to on-pump and typical cross-clamp to on-pump group, respectively. Following cross-clamp, DCD liver grafts should be placed on the NMP pump as quickly as is safely and logistically possible. In cases where delays are unavoidable, such as waiting for biopsy results or liver reallocation with another center, acceptable results can still be achieved, and therefore, livers with prolonged times should still be used.","Lee, C.; Mathur, A.

To minimize BCs and improve surgical outcomes, indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence intensity (FI) is used to assess bile duct perfusion. This study investigated the association between ICG FI in the common bile duct (CBD) and postoperative BCs in patients undergoing LDLT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, FI parameters (maximum intensity, half-maximal intensity, time to maximum, time to half-maximal intensity, and slope) were analyzed using ImageJ. Fifty-four patients aged ≥19 years who underwent LDLT at our single tertiary hospital between July 2022 and December 2023 were included, with a 1-year follow-up period for BCs. The exclusion criteria were re-transplantation, multi-organ transplants, or hepaticojejunostomy. Following hepatic vein, portal vein, and hepatic artery anastomoses, ICG (0.05 mg/kg) was administered intravenously before biliary reconstruction. CBD FI was measured at 10-s intervals for 3 minutes. The primary outcome was BC occurrence <1 year, and the primary predictor was the FI increase slope. RESULTS: Among 54 patients, 12 (22.2%) developed BCs, with 9 occurring in <3 months. No significant differences were observed in age, sex, body mass index, bile duct anatomy, anastomosis method, operator, operation time, graft-to-recipient weight ratio, and warm ischemic time between patients with and without BCs. However, a low slope (≤0.8), ABO (ABO blood group) incompatibility, and cold ischemic time >135.5 minutes were significantly associated with BC occurrence ( P = 0.008, P = 0.031, and P = 0.009, respectively). Logistic regression further identified low slope and delayed cold ischemic time as independent risk factors (hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval: 0.09, 0.01-0.82, P = 0.032; and 6.07, 1.29-28.59, P = 0.023, respectively). CONCLUSION: ICG FI slope ≤0.8 and cold ischemic time >135.5 minutes were identified as potential risk factors for BCs following LDLT.

However, there is a shortage of donor hearts available. The short tolerable cold ischemic time for delivering donor hearts to matching recipients is closely responsible for this shortage. Here we uncover the phenomenon of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) phase separation, which exacerbates injury to the murine and human donor heart during cold storage and can be modulated with pharmacological inhibition to improve preservation quality. Interestingly, donor cardiomyocytes strongly expressed MR, which undergoes preservation-related phase separation. The phenomenon of macromolecular phase separation is not limited to the heart or MR during preservation. Cold preservation of the lung, liver and kidney also displays phase separation of other transcriptional regulators including histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), bromodomain-containing 4 (BRD4) and MR. Our results reveal an understudied area of preservation biology that may be further exploited to improve the preservation of multiple solid organs.","Lei, I.; Sicim, H.; Gao, W.; Huang, W.; Noly, P.

On a cellular level, ALF is characterized by massive hepatocyte death due to different types of cellular demise. Compensatory hyperplasia and functional recovery are possible when the regenerative capacity is sufficient to sustain hepatic function. ALF has a high mortality of about 30% and can lead to death in a very short time despite maximum therapeutic intervention. Besides aetiology-specific therapy and intensive care, the therapeutic option of emergency liver transplantation has significantly improved the prognosis of patients with ALF. However, due to limiting factors such as organ shortage, many patients die on the waiting list. In addition to graft assessment, machine perfusion may have the potential to recondition marginal organs and thus expand the organ donor pool.","Lemmer, P.; Sowa, J.

Between 2019 and 2023, 262 ECD-DBD grafts from 8 French centers were randomly assigned for LT either after SCS (control group, n = 131) or after SCS and subsequent 1-4 h single portal HOPE before implantation (HOPE group, n = 131). The primary endpoint was the incidence of EAD. HOPE resulted in a significantly lower rate of EAD (17.6% vs 30.5%, P = .01). Severe complication rate (61.5% vs 52.4%, P = .15), comprehensive complication index (49 [34-65] vs 46 [35-65], P = .78), and 90-day mortality (5.3% vs 2.3%, P = .20) did not differ significantly between the control and HOPE groups, respectively.

We have shown that FOXP1 contributes to the expansion of human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) and acute myeloid leukemia cells. Here, we investigated the role of FOXP1 in early adult mouse hematopoiesis in vivo. We showed that loss of hematopoietic-specific FOXP1 expression leads to attrition of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) and multipotent progenitor (MPP)-1 compartment in parallel with enhancement of myeloid-biased MPP3 in adult bone marrow and fetal liver. Transplantation experiments confirmed that FOXP1-deficient bone marrow had an intrinsic reduced HSC compartment. FOXP1-deficient MPP compartments also showed enhanced proliferation with G0 phase reduction. Transcriptome analyses revealed that FOXP1-deficient HSC exhibited reduced stemness and enhanced expression of cell proliferation pathways. Thus, our current results revealed that FOXP1 plays a critical role in early murine hematopoiesis by maintaining HSCs, limiting the expansion of all MPP compartments, and restricting early myeloid commitment in vivo.","Levavasseur, F.; Oussous, S.; Framarini, A.; Boussaid, I.; Gou, P.; Tuerdi, Z.; Boueya, I.

METHODS: Patients with PBC were recruited from a physician panel and patient advocacy group. Participants were grouped by the Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS): No/Mild Pruritus (NMP, NRS < 4) and Moderate/Severe Pruritus (MSP, NRS ≥ 4). Participants completed the 5-D Itch, PBC-40, EQ-5D-5L, Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire (CLDQ-PBC), Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI), and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue Scale, Version 4 (FACIT-Fatigue) questionnaires, and PBC treatment experiences questions. Differences were analysed using regression models for confounders. An MSP group subset responded to voice questions. RESULTS: The sample included 40 NMP and 50 MSP participants, with 85% and 80% females, respectively. The MSP group reported significantly worse outcomes on 5-D Itch, EQ-5D Index, PBC-40 (all domains besides Emotional), FACIT-Fatigue, and CLDQ-PBC total scores compared to the NMP group (all p < 0.05). The MSP group reported significantly greater activity impairment due to PBC (57%) than the NMP group (36%; p < 0.001). The MSP group had a lower employment rate (42%) than the NMP group (53%). Fewer than 25% of the MSP group were receiving itch treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with PBC and pruritus report limited pruritus treatment use and minimal itch relief. Those with moderate/severe pruritus experience a greater HRQoL burden and reduced activity compared to those with mild/no pruritus. This highlights the need for effective treatments that ameliorate pruritus in patients with PBC.","Levy, C.; Younossi, Z. M.; Mayo, M. J.; Kremer, A.

However, even when adequate future liver remnant is achieved, postoperative hepatic insufficiency is not universally averted. We aimed to identify preoperative risk factors of postoperative hepatic insufficiency despite the use of portal vein embolization. METHODS: Patients who underwent portal vein embolization followed by major hepatectomy at 6 academic medical centers were retrospectively reviewed. Postoperative hepatic insufficiency was defined as postoperative peak bilirubin >7 mg/dL. Preoperative variables associated with postoperative hepatic insufficiency were analyzed. RESULTS: From 2008 to 2019, 164 patients underwent portal vein embolization followed by major hepatectomy. Twenty (12%) patients developed postoperative hepatic insufficiency. On univariate analysis, postoperative hepatic insufficiency was associated with older age, performance status, preoperative biliary drainage, smaller pre- and post-portal vein embolization future liver remnant volumes, diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma/gallbladder cancer, and preoperative cholangitis. There was significant future liver remnant hypertrophy noted even in the setting of postoperative hepatic insufficiency (from 27% to 39%); however, degree of hypertrophy >5% (100% vs 93%, P = .6) and kinetic growth rate >2%/week (95% vs 82%, P = .3) did not differ between the postoperative hepatic insufficiency and non-postoperative hepatic insufficiency groups. On multivariate analysis, the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma/gallbladder cancer and preoperative cholangitis (postoperative hepatic insufficiency incidence 34% and 62%, respectively), but not future liver remnant volumetrics, were independently associated with postoperative hepatic insufficiency. Postoperative hepatic insufficiency raised post-hepatectomy 90-day mortality from 3.5% to 45% and hospitalization from 7 days to 16 days (both P < .001). CONCLUSION: Postoperative hepatic insufficiency still occurs in 12% of patients after major hepatectomy despite preoperative portal vein embolization. In addition to traditional volumetric information, surgeons should be aware of preoperative cholangitis and cholangiocarcinoma/gallbladder cancer as powerful predictors of this fatal complication.","Li, A.

However, its complexity has limited its widespread adoption. This study introduced a simplified ischemia-free liver transplantation (SIFLT) technique by providing an alternating flow of the portal vein and hepatic artery, demonstrating its efficacy and safety. In this retrospective study, 32 patients who received SIFLT and 32 who received CIFLT were included between January 2021 and January 2024. The intraoperative and postoperative outcomes were collected and elevated. Patients who underwent SIFLT had a shorter anhepatic phase (44.0±2.4 vs. 51.6±2.4 min, p =0.03), along with a comparatively reduced intraoperative blood loss compared to those who underwent CIFLT. Furthermore, the SIFLT group exhibited significantly lower peak AST levels within postoperative 7 days (413.1±62.6 vs. 707.5±110.7 U/L, p =0.02). The incidence of early allograft dysfunction, primary nonfunction, and transplant-related complications were similar across both groups. There were no significant differences in the number of Clavien-Dindo classification of surgical complications and comprehensive complication index at 3 months after transplantation. Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed similar patient and graft survival rates. The subgroup analysis of extended criteria donor demonstrated that SIFLT can effectively reduce anhepatic phase and intraoperative blood loss and can achieve a clinical prognosis similar to CIFLT. Additionally, histological analysis revealed that both groups demonstrated well-preserved livers and bile ducts. The SIFLT simplifies the intricate surgical procedure while ensuring the protection of livers from ischemia-reperfusion injury. This technique holds promise for enabling patients to achieve clinical outcomes comparable to those of CIFLT.","Li, J.; Qin, M.; Tang, Y.; Dan, J.; Chen, H.; Chen, H.; Huang, J.; Yang, Y.; Wang, T.; Li, Y.; Chen, M.; Ju, W.; Wang, D.; Guo, Z.; Tan, H.; He, X.; Zhao, Q.",2025,Liver Transpl,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,39510097.0,10.3350/cmh.2024.0854,Stem cell exosomes: new hope and future potential for relieving liver fibrosis,"Liver fibrosis is a chronic liver injury resulting from factors like viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, fatty liver disease, and cholestatic liver disease. Liver transplantation is currently the gold standard for treating severe liver diseases. However, it is limited by a shortage of donor organs and the necessity for lifelong immunosuppressive therapy. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can differentiate into various liver cells and enhance liver function when transplanted into patients due to their differentiation and proliferation capabilities. Therefore, it can be used as an alternative therapy for treating liver diseases, especially for liver cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver transplant complications. However, due to the potential tumorigenic effects of MSCs, researchers are exploring a new approach to treating liver fibrosis using extracellular vesicles (exosomes) secreted by stem cells. Many studies show that exosomes released by stem cells can promote liver injury repair through various pathways, contributing to the treatment of liver fibrosis. In this review, we focus on the molecular mechanisms by which stem cell exosomes affect liver fibrosis through different pathways and their potential therapeutic targets. Additionally, we discuss the advantages of exosome therapy over stem cell therapy and the possible future directions of exosome research, including the prospects for clinical applications and the challenges to be overcome.","Li, L.; Liu, Y.; Wang, K.; Mo, J.; Weng, Z.; Jiang, H.; Jin, C.",2025,Clin Mol Hepatol,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
56,40189683.0,10.1038/s41598-025-96265-3,HOPE and AMPK activation reduce reperfusion injury and metabolic dysfunction in primate steatotic liver grafts,"Living liver transplantation has become a significant and evolving aspect of organ transplantation, with a notable proportion of cases involving pediatric patients. Metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is the most prevalent chronic liver disease. The growing number of individuals with MAFLD has led to an annual increase in the proportion of non-alcoholic fatty liver donors for pediatric living liver transplantation. Hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE) has been demonstrated to improve graft quality through the implementation of a continuous mechanical perfusion cycle. However, there is currently a paucity of evidence regarding its ability to reduce steatosis and improve prognosis within a shorter time window of living-organ transplantation, especially in primate models. This study simulated steatotic liver grafts in living liver transplantation using the MAFLD model of the cynomolgus monkey and explored the effects of HOPE combined with the AMPK activator AICAR on the amelioration of the donor liver. The left outer lobe livers were statically cold preserved for two hours, subjected to HOPE for two hours, or treated with HOPE + AICAR (1 mmol/L) for two hours, respectively. Subsequently, a normothermic ex vivo reperfusion model (IRM) simulating post-transplant reperfusion was established using diluted autologous blood. Following simulated reperfusion in vitro, steatotic liver grafts in the static cold preservation group exhibited notable reperfusion injury. The degree of reperfusion injury induced by the remaining two groups was reduced, with the HOPE + AICAR group showing the most significant reduction (P < 0.05). The adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level of the hepatic tissues in the HOPE + AICAR group was observed to improve at two hours of reperfusion, exhibiting a significantly higher level than that in the cold-preserved group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the HOPE + AICAR group exhibited a notable decline in MDA levels (P < 0.05), accompanied by a considerable reduction in 8-OHdG and lactate concentrations in both the liver tissue and perfusate. Additionally, there was a marked decrease in the release of TNF-α and IL-6 cytokines, along with a reduction in TLR-4 activation (P < 0.05). In comparison to the cold-preserved and HOPE groups, the HOPE + AICAR group demonstrated the capacity to alter the degree of steatosis following a two-hour treatment period, as evidenced by a notable reduction in liver tissue triglyceride and cholesterol levels (P < 0.05). Additionally, p-AMPK levels in liver tissue were significantly increased in the HOPE + AICAR group (P < 0.05). The combination of HOPE and AMPK activators has been shown to reduce the degree of steatotic liver grafts in a relatively short time, significantly reduce reperfusion injury, and improve liver function. This study contributes to the existing body of knowledge on mechanical perfusion in primate models, addressing a previously identified gap in the literature.","Li, T.; Chang, P.; Wang, Y.; Song, Y.; Qu, P.; Wang, B.; Lyu, Y.; Hu, L.",2025,Sci Rep,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83,40089898.0,10.1111/ctr.70133,Normothermic Machine Perfusion Improves Outcomes for Donation After Cardiac Death Allografts With Extended Donor Warm Ischemia Time,"INTRODUCTION: Donation after circulatory death (DCD) allografts are underutilized in liver transplantation (LT) due to increased risk of complications. These risks stem from ischemic injury sustained during the total donor warm ischemia time (tDWIT), historically limited to 30 min. Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) can mitigate these risks and facilitate LT of DCD grafts with extended tDWIT. We aimed to compare outcomes of DCD allografts with extended tDWIT preserved on NMP versus static cold storage (SCS). METHODS: This single-center study included adult DCD LT with tDWIT ≥ 30 from 2019 to 2023. Outcomes of NMP and SCS were compared including EAD, IC, graft survival, and patient survival. RESULTS: Among 68 DCD LT with tDWIT ≥ 30, 64.7% (n = 44) were preserved with NMP and 35.3% (n = 24) with SCS. No differences in donor or recipient demographics were observed. The median tDWIT was 33 min for NMP and 30.5 min for SCS (p < 0.01). Despite longer tDWIT, the NMP group had lower rates of EAD (4.5% vs. 66.7%, p < 0.01) and IC (2.3% vs. 29.2%, p < 0.01). One-year graft survival was higher in NMP (p < 0.01), and 1-year patient survival was comparable between groups (p = 0.18). CONCLUSION: NMP challenges traditional tDWIT constraints and can increase the pool of viable DCD allografts for transplantation.","Li, X.; Chang, Y. H.; Ohara, S. Y.; Reddy, K. S.; Jadlowiec, C.

89,40276834.0,10.4166/kjg.2025.013,Application of Steatotic Donor Livers in Liver Transplantation,"The growing prevalence of fatty liver disease in donor livers has become a critical focus in liver transplantation due to the global shortage of viable grafts. This article reviews the challenges and advancements in utilizing steatotic donor livers, emphasizing their increased risk of post-transplant complications, such as primary non-function and early allograft dysfunction. Mechanistically, macrovesicular and microvesicular steatosis differentially impair lipid metabolism, exacerbate ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), and disrupt hepatic microcirculation, contributing to graft failure. Innovations in donor assessment, including magnetic resonance imaging-proton density fat fraction and AI-enhanced imaging, have improved fat quantification accuracy, while machine perfusion techniques (e.g., hypothermic oxygenated perfusion and normothermic machine perfusion) show promise in mitigating IRI and enhancing preservation, particularly for marginal steatotic livers. However, controversies persist regarding standardized fat-content thresholds, ischemia tolerance limits, and heterogeneity in risk stratification. Future research highlights the need for non-invasive subtyping technologies, dynamic preservation strategies guided by real-time biomarkers, and multi-omics approaches to unravel steatosis-related molecular pathways. Addressing these challenges may expand the safe use of steatotic grafts and alleviate organ shortages.","Li, X.; Yin, X.; Xu, J.; Geng, L.",2025,Korean J Gastroenterol,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transcripts were analyzed using Colaizzi's descriptive analysis framework, with collaborative analysis conducted using NVivo 12 software and a post-traumatic growth model.Results: Five themes were identified: (a) experiencing a devastating blow, (b) cognitive reconstruction under overwhelming pain, (c) an arduous journey of decision-making, (d) rebirth in adversity and (e) post-traumatic growth. Parents undergo significant post-traumatic responses to their child's diagnosis of biliary atresia and liver transplantation, marking two major traumatic events. During the diagnostic stage, parents experience intense post-traumatic reactions characterized by emotional fluctuations and intrusive thoughts. The early treatment phase represents a crucial time for parents to transition from `denial of reality' to `accepting diseases'. The process of liver transplantation is also a significant traumatic event, accompanied by a final hope. Parents in the stable period after liver transplantation feel fortunate, hopeful and grateful, and their post-traumatic growth manifests gradually.Conclusions: Parents' experience of post-traumatic growth involves dynamic changes. Tailored intervention strategies should be developed for different stages to enhance their post-traumatic growth and psychological well-being. During the early treatment stage, mental health professionals could provide cognitive interventions to encourage parents to express their negative emotions and guide them to develop positive cognition toward traumatic events. The coping strategies and increasing personal growth are also important. In the postoperative stage, mental health professionals need to fully evaluate the coping styles of parents, and encourage them to establish effective internal coping strategies, while classic gratitude interventions could be given during the post-traumatic growth stage. Future research could involve a longitudinal qualitative study to explore parents' post-traumatic growth experiences at different stages of their children's transplantation process. The experience of post-traumatic growth among parents of paediatric living related liver transplantion presenting dynamic changes, and different responses were displayed in each stage, the child’s diagnosis with biliary atresia and receiving liver transplantation treatment are both two major traumatic events for parents, with significant post-trauma response.A positive reassessment of traumatic event is the key for parents to perform active cognitive reconstruction, achieve a transformation from ‘denial of reality’ to ‘accepting diseases’ and move towards growth, and healthcare providers should guide them to develop positive cognition towards traumatic events.We highlighted the importance of coping strategies and gaining personal growth. Healthcare providers should fully evaluate the coping styles of parents and encourage them to establish effective internal coping strategies, and provide targeted psychological interventions at different stages to improve their post-traumatic growth level and psychological well-being, especially those served as both donors and primary caregivers. eng","Li, Z.; Lu, F.; Dong, L.; Zheng, L.; Wu, J.; Wu, S.; Wang, Y.; Wang, H.",2025,Eur J Psychotraumatol,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has the potential to transform liver transplantation (LT) from an urgent to a purely elective procedure, which could revolutionize LT logistics, reduce burden on patients and health care providers, and decrease costs., Methods: A 31-item survey was sent to international transplant directors to gather their NMP experiences and vision. In addition, we performed a systematic review on cost-analysis in LT and assessed studies on cost-benefit in converting urgent-to-elective procedures. We compared the costs of available NMPs and conducted a sensitivity analysis of NMP's cost benefits., Results: Of 120 transplant programs contacted, 64 (53%) responded, spanning North America (31%), Europe (42%), Asia (22%), and South America (5%). Of the total, 60% had adopted NMP, with larger centers (>100 transplants/year) in North America and Europe more likely to use it. The main NMP systems were OrganOx-metra (39%), XVIVO (36%), and TransMedics-OCS (15%). Despite NMP adoption, 41% of centers still perform >50% of LTs at nights/weekends. Centers recognized NMP's benefits, including improved work satisfaction and patient outcomes, but faced challenges like high costs and machine complexity. 16% would invest $100,000 to 500'000, 33% would invest $50,000 to 100'000, 38% would invest $10,000 to 50'000, and 14% would invest <$10,000 in NMP. These results were strengthened by a cost analysis for NMP in emergency-to-elective LT transition. Accordingly, while liver perfusions with disposables up to $10,000 resulted in overall positive net balances, this effect was lost when disposables' cost amounted to >$40,000/organ., Conclusions: The adoption of NMP is hindered by high costs and operational complexity.

Fortunately, the incidence of primary non-function (PNF) has significantly decreased from 8% in the 1980's to < 2%, but PNF and hepatic artery thromboses remain the leading reasons for early emergency retransplantation. Other indications for early retransplantation include severe biliary or vascular complications and refractory rejection. Fortunately, the need for late retransplantation (> 1 year) has also declined due to improved immunosuppression, earlier detection of recurrent disease, and use of oral antiviral agents for recurrent hepatitis C. Patient survival with retransplantation is consistently lower than with primary liver transplantation. Risk factors for poor outcomes with retransplantation include a higher MELD score, ICU status, renal failure, and use of marginal allografts. Therefore, most centers use younger, whole deceased brain-dead donor organs whenever possible. However, increased use of machine perfused livers has expanded the donor pool for these more complex and technically challenging cases. Retransplant recipients have a higher rate of early technical, infectious, and cardiovascular complications compared to primary LT recipients. Going forward, LT recipients with recurrent steatotic and alcoholic liver disease will likely pose ethical, medical, and surgical challenges to the transplant community.","Likhitsup, A.; Fontana, R.

Such exposures and PF contamination may be avoided in ischaemia-free liver transplantation (IFLT) because of the strict sterile surgical procedures. In this study, the authors evaluated the impact of IFLT on organ PF contamination., Methods: A post-hoc analysis using data from the first randomized controlled trial of IFLT was performed to compare the incidence, pathogenic spectrum of PF contamination, and incidence of early recipient infection between IFLT and CLT. Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore risk factors for PF contamination., Results: Of the 68 cases recruited in the trial, 64 were included in this post-hoc analysis. The incidence of culture-positive PF was 9.4% (3/32) in the IFLT group versus 78.1% (25/32) in the CLT group (P<0.001). Three microorganisms were isolated from PF in the IFLT group, while 43 were isolated in the CLT group. The recipient infection rate within postoperative day 14 was 3.1% (1/32) in the IFLT group vs 15.6% (5/32) in the CLT group, although this difference did not reach statistical significance (P=0.196). Multivariate analysis revealed that adopting IFLT is an independent protective factor for culture-positive PF., Conclusion: PF contamination is substantially decreased in IFLT, and IFLT application is an independent protective factor for PF contamination.

Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) allows for ex-vivo perfusion under physiologic conditions with the potential to significantly increase organ yield and expand the donor pool., Recent findings: Several studies have found increased utilization of donation after cardiac death and extended criteria brain-dead donor livers with implementation of NMP, largely due to the ability to perform viability testing during machine perfusion. Recently, proposed viability criteria include lactate clearance, maintenance of perfusate pH more than 7.2, ALT less than 6000 u/l, evidence of glucose metabolism and bile production. Optimization of liver grafts during NMP is an active area of research and includes interventions for defatting steatotic livers, preventing ischemic cholangiopathy and rejection, and minimizing ischemia reperfusion injury., Summary: NMP has resulted in increased organ utilization from marginal donors with acceptable outcomes.

Until recently, HAI was only performed at a limited number of centers. We previously reported early outcomes suggesting that implementation of a new HAI program is safe and feasible. Here, we report perioperative and oncologic outcomes from an expanded series of patients with uCRLM treated with HAI. METHODS: We analyzed outcomes from consecutive patients with uCRLM who underwent HAI pump (HAIP) placement at Duke University Hospital from 2018 to 2023. Demographics, prior treatment, and perioperative and oncologic outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: Overall, 102 patients underwent HAIP placement for uCRLM; 62% were male and median age was 51 years. Most patients (97%) received a median of 12 (range 0-66) prior chemotherapy cycles. Postoperative HAI-specific complications occurred in 23% of patients, including biliary sclerosis in 6%, and the 90-day mortality rate was 3%. 20% converted to resection, 4% underwent transplant, and 2% achieved complete response at 6 months after floxuridine initiation. Median hepatic and extrahepatic progression-free survival (PFS) was 15.7 months and 11.6 months, respectively. Median overall survival (OS) was 38 months from the time of pump implantation (median follow-up time: 30 months). CONCLUSIONS: HAI for uCRLM is safe, feasible, and effective at a new center, with outcomes that recapitulate those previously reported by established centers.

Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation can reverse this capillarization and reduce fibrosis, but MSC therapy has practical limitations that hinder its clinical use. Here, with the help of artificial intelligence (AI), we show that MSCs secrete a microRNA (miR-325-3p) that helps restore LSEC fenestrations (tiny pores) by modulating their cytoskeleton, effectively reversing capillarization. We further develop a spherical nucleic acid (SNA) nanoparticle carrying miR-325-3p as an alternative to MSC therapy. This SNA specifically enters fibrotic LSECs via the scavenger receptor A (Scara). In three mouse models of liver fibrosis, the SNA treatment restores LSEC fenestrations, reverses capillarization, and significantly reduces fibrosis without adverse effects.

Recent advancements in NMP system design have prompted the development of clinically effective devices for liver, heart, lung, and kidney transplantation that preserve organs for several hours/up to 1 d. In preclinical studies, adjustments to circuit structure, perfusate composition, and automatic supervision have extended perfusion times up to 1 wk of preservation. Emerging NMP platforms for ex vivo preservation of the pancreas, intestine, uterus, ovary, and vascularized composite allografts represent exciting prospects. Thus, NMP may become a valuable tool in transplantation and provide significant advantages to biomedical research. This review recaps recent NMP research, including discussions of devices in clinical trials, innovative preclinical systems for extended preservation, and platforms developed for other organs.

166,40230344.0,10.1111/ctr.70140,Center-Level Variability in Use of Normothermic Machine Perfusion and the Association With Recipient Insurance,"BACKGROUND: The rapid implementation of normothermic machine perfusion (NMP), since the FDA-approved NMP devices, has resulted in a paradigm shift in the ability to use marginal livers and allow for daytime operations. A major rate-limiting factor is costs which could lead to disparities among recipients. We aim to evaluate center-level variability in utilization of NMP, and to determine whether recipient insurance type was associated with NMP. METHODS: We evaluated deceased donor liver transplants in high-volume NMP centers between January 2022 and December 2023, using the national registry. The primary outcome was whether the DDLT was performed using NMP. To explore center-level and factors associated with NMP, we evaluated variables related to donor quality and insurance. We fit multivariable logistic regression models to evaluate these factors. RESULTS: Out of 142 liver transplant centers, 72 had ≥1 DDLT using NMP, and 28 were high-volume NMP centers. There was marked center-level variability in the proportion of donation after brain death (DCD) versus donation after brain death (DBD) allografts that underwent NMP. In logistic regression, liver allografts procured using NMP were more likely to occur during the nighttime (OR 1.26, p < 0.001), more likely to be used for DCD allografts (OR 13.2, p < 0.001), and less likely to occur in recipients insured by Medicaid, Medicare, or the Veterans Health Administration. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates center-level variability in the use of NMP, and factors associated with these differences. Although the change in practice may help to increase DCD utilization, and shift the timing of transplants, the disparity based on insurance is alarming.","Lopimpisuth, C.; Goldberg, D.

While gut microbiota dysbiosis has been linked to transplant outcomes, the role of the intrahepatic graft's native microbiota remains unexplored. OBJECTIVE: To characterise the microbial profile detected in organ preservation solution (OPS) and determine whether specific microbial taxa are associated with short-term clinical outcomes, and to develop predictive models for risk stratification. DESIGN: We analysed the OPS microbiota-based metataxonomic signature from 110 LT donors (discovery cohort) and an independent validation cohort (n=29) using 16S rRNA sequencing. Microbial DNA signatures associated with clinical outcomes were identified through MaAsLin2-adjusted models, and relevant gene pathways were uncovered via data mining and enrichment analysis. Machine learning (ML) models were developed to predict outcomes based on microbial features, and host-microbiome interactions were validated through RNA sequencing (RNA-seq of matched liver biopsies). RESULTS: OPS-derived microbial DNA signature closely resembled liver/bile microbiomes (Proteobacteria-dominated). Specific genera (eg, Bacillus, Prevotella) were differentially abundant in adverse outcomes (p<0.05): hyperabundant in non-survivors and hepatic artery thrombosis, hypoabundant in acute rejection (AR). Gene mining linked these taxa to immune/metabolic pathways relevant to LT outcomes. RNA-seq validated upregulation of chemokines (CCL/CXCL families) in liver grafts from non-surviving recipients. ML models accurately predicted global survival (area under the curve (AUC)=0.95) and AR (AUC=0.96) based on microbial features, with generalisability confirmed in the validation cohort (AUC=0.85-0.88). CONCLUSION: Donor intrahepatic microbial DNA signature predicts LT outcomes via immune-metabolic modulation. While causality requires further study, these findings position the graft microbiome as a novel biomarker and potential therapeutic target, paving the way for microbiome-informed precision care in transplantation.","Lucas-Ruiz, F.; Vidal-Correoso, D.; Mateo, S.

This study aims to demonstrate the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of hepatic administration of bone marrow-derived (BM)-MSCs in a large pig model relevant to human anatomy. After complete vascular exclusion for 45 min, 3 × 10(6) human BM-MSCs/kg body weight were infused via the portal vein or hepatic artery. BM-MSC infusion did not cause obstruction of hepatic or pulmonary blood flow within 6 h after infusion. Cells were effectively retained in the liver, being undetectable in peripheral blood, lung, and spleen samples. Human B2M expression, as a marker for BM-MSC presence, was significantly higher for the left liver lobe in arterial infusion compared to portal infusion. In liver samples with high BM-MSC levels, we identified the prevention of up- or downregulation of some genes related to inflammation and energy metabolism that was present in non-treated control samples, indicating biological effects within 6 h of infusion. We conclude that hepatic BM-MSC infusion is feasible and safe, with the hepatic artery serving as the optimal administration route for homogenous distribution. These findings pave the way for clinical studies on MSC infusion in IRI, either in situ in liver conditions or ex situ during machine perfusion.","Luijmes, S. H.; van Kooten, J. P.; Roest, H.

188,40386942.0,10.1111/aor.15024,Development of a Protocol for Long-Term Ex Vivo Normothermic Machine Perfusion of Rodent Livers,"INTRODUCTION: Long-term normothermic machine perfusion (LT-NMP) enables the assessment and optimization of livers for days and, potentially, weeks. However, models of LT-NMP have only been described for human and pig livers, which are resource intensive and impractical for laboratory research. Cost-effective small animal models of LT-NMP are needed for future research. This study aimed to develop a system for LT-NMP of rat livers for up to 72 h. METHODS: This study was performed in two stages: the development phase (n = 20) and validation phase (n = 5). The perfusion system included an organ reservoir, pump, heat exchanger, long-term oxygenator, and dialysis. Hormonal and nutritional support were continuously infused. During the validation phase, five consecutive grafts were perfused using our protocol. At 72 h postreperfusion, grafts were assessed for viability, which was based on hemodynamic stability, mitochondrial function, bile production, and metabolic activity. RESULTS: Rodent livers were supported up to 107 h using our LT-NMP protocol. All grafts in the validation phase remained viable at 72 h (n = 5/5). The median oxygen consumption and bile production at 72 h were 0.079 mLO(2)/min/g-liver and 8.6 uL/h/g-liver, respectively. All grafts had a systemic vascular resistance less than 0.25 mmHg/mL/min. Metabolic activity, defined as lactate clearance, glucose production, or response to glucagon, was observed in all grafts (5/5). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to report LT-NMP of rodent livers up to 5 days. Using our protocol, rat livers could reliably be supported until 72 h. This model provides a greater opportunity to investigate novel therapeutics to assess, optimize, and regenerate liver grafts for transplantation.","Ly, M.; Babekuhl, D.; Niu, A.; Yousif, P.; Wang, C.; Lau, N.

Assessing the capacity for biliary regeneration may identify grafts as suitable for transplantation that are currently declined, but this has been unfeasible until now. This study used long-term ex situ normothermic machine perfusion (LT-NMP) to assess biliary regeneration. Human livers that were declined for transplantation were perfused at 36 °C for up to 13.5 days. Bile duct biopsies, bile, and perfusate were collected throughout perfusion, which were examined for features of injury and regeneration. Biliary regeneration was defined as new Ki-67-positive biliary epithelium following severe injury. Ten livers were perfused for a median duration of 7.5 days. Severe bile duct injury occurred in all grafts, and biliary regeneration occurred in 70% of grafts. Traditional biomarkers of biliary viability such as bile glucose improved during perfusion but this was not associated with biliary regeneration (P > .05). In contrast, the maintenance of interleukin-6 and vascular endothelial growth factor-A levels in bile was associated with biliary regeneration (P = .017 for both cytokines). This is the first study to demonstrate biliary regeneration during LT-NMP and identify a cytokine signature in bile as a novel biomarker for biliary regeneration during LT-NMP.","Ly, M.; Lau, N.

This study described a novel technique for performing ex vivo cholangioscopy during cold static storage and normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) to assess the biliary tree before liver transplantation. METHODS: Human donor livers, which were considered unsuitable for transplantation, were perfused at 36ºC using a modified commercial ex vivo perfusion system. Ex vivo cholangioscopy was performed using a SpyGlass Discover system. Cholangioscopy was performed during cold static storage and after 12 hours in NMP. Bile duct biopsies and confocal microscopy were performed. RESULTS: Ex vivo cholangioscopy was performed on eight grafts. During cold static storage, luminal debris was visualized throughout the biliary tree. After 12 hours of reperfusion, the bile ducts appeared hyperemic, heterogeneous, and mottled. Confocal microscopy confirmed perfusion of biliary microvasculature. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the first use of ex vivo cholangioscopy to assess the biliary tree before liver transplantation. This real-time technique can be used to assess biliary trees during cold static storage and NMP. In addition, cholangioscopy-based interventions can be used to better assess intrahepatic bile ducts.","Ly, M.; Lau, N.

112,39856052.0,10.1038/s41467-025-55923-w,NKp46 enhances type 1 innate lymphoid cell proliferation and function and anti-acute myeloid leukemia activity,"NKp46 is a critical regulator of natural killer (NK) cell immunity, but its function in non-NK innate immune cells remains unclear. Here, we show that NKp46 is indispensable for expressing IL-2 receptor-α (IL-2Rα) by non-NK liver-resident type-1 innate lymphoid cells (ILC1s). Deletion of NKp46 reduces IL-2Rα on ILC1s by downregulating NF-κB signaling, thus impairing ILC1 proliferation and cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. The binding of anti-NKp46 antibody to NKp46 triggers the activation of NF-κB, the expression of IL-2Rα, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), proliferation, and cytotoxicity. Functionally, NKp46 expressed on mouse ILC1s interacts with tumor cells through cell-cell contact, increasing ILC1 production of IFN-γ and TNF, and enhancing cytotoxicity. In a mouse model of acute myeloid leukemia, deletion of NKp46 impairs the ability of ILC1s to control tumor growth and reduces survival. This can be reversed by injecting NKp46(+) ILC1s into NKp46 knock-out mice. Human NKp46(+) ILC1s exhibit stronger cytokine production and cytotoxicity than their NKp46(-) counterparts, suggesting that NKp46 plays a similar role in humans. These findings identify an NKp46-NF-κB-IL-2Rα axis and suggest that activating NKp46 with an anti-NKp46 antibody may provide a potential strategy for anti-tumor innate immunity.","Ma, R.; Li, Z.; Tang, H.; Wu, X.; Tian, L.; Shah, Z.; Liu, N.; Barr, T.; Zhang, J.; Wang, S.; Swaminathan, S.; Marcucci, G.; Peng, Y.; Caligiuri, M.

349,40217819.0,10.3390/jcm14072368,Comparative Analysis Between Insulated Gel Bags and Direct Cooling for Temperature Management During Kidney Transplant Vascular Anastomosis,"Background/Objectives: Ischemic time plays a crucial role in graft function and survival during kidney transplantation. Cooling methods, including cold perfusion and ice slush, are predominantly applied to preserve the kidney, but they may cause uneven cooling and complications. The Organ Pocket(®), an insulated gel bag, has been introduced as an alternative cooling method. However, no studies have compared renal temperature changes between the Organ Pocket(®) and conventional cooling methods. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 49 cases of living-donor kidney transplantation. Among these, 33 received kidney grafts preserved with the Organ Pocket(®) (OP group), and 16 underwent conventional cooling (control group). Renal surface temperatures were recorded at 5 min intervals during vascular anastomosis using thermography. Postoperative renal function was assessed with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), serum creatinine (sCr), and liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP) levels. Results: The OP group demonstrated significantly higher renal surface temperatures than the control group during vascular anastomosis (p < 0.05). Renal surface temperature before reperfusion was 20.4 °C ± 2.5 °C and 17.2 °C ± 2.5 °C in the OP and control groups, respectively. No significant differences in postoperative eGFR, sCr, and L-FABP levels; delayed graft function (DGF); or acute rejection rates were observed between the groups. Conclusions: The Organ Pocket(®) effectively stabilized renal temperatures during vascular anastomosis without direct cooling, thereby reducing continuous manual cooling requirements. Short-term renal function outcomes were comparable between groups; however, the Organ Pocket(®) may improve surgical efficiency and be particularly beneficial in robot-assisted kidney transplantation. Further studies are warranted to investigate its long-term benefits.","Machida, Y.; Iwai, T.; Kabei, K.; Uchida, J.",2025,J Clin Med,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
168,39291684.0,10.1111/aor.14862,Perfusate hemoglobin during normothermic liver machine perfusion as biomarker of early allograft dysfunction: A pilot study,"BACKGROUND: Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) aims to reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury in donor livers and its clinical manifestation, early allograft dysfunction (EAD) by maintaining perfusion and oxygenation. However, there is limited data on which NMP perfusate biomarkers might be associated with such EAD and the role of perfusate hemoglobin has not been assessed. METHODS: We performed a pilot retrospective analysis of adult donor livers undergoing NMP between 2020 and 2022 at our center. NMP was commenced at the recipient hospital after initial static cold storage. All NMP circuits were primed in the same manner according to the manufacturer's instructions. Livers were stratified by initial perfusate hemoglobin below (≤5.2 mmol/L) or above (>5.2 mmol/L) the median. The association between hemoglobin levels and EAD or recipient peak transaminase levels was assessed. RESULTS: Among 23 livers, eight were considered unsuitable for transplantation, leaving 15 livers for assessment. Higher initial hemoglobin was associated with a lower risk of EAD (0% vs. 55.6%, p = 0.04). Perfusate hemoglobin decreased after NMP initiation (p = 0.003) and negatively correlated with recipient peak transaminase levels (ALT: ρ = -0.72, p = 0.002; AST: ρ = -0.79, p < 0.001). Consistently, higher hemoglobin livers also demonstrated lower perfusate liver enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: Perfusate hemoglobin levels decreased during NMP, and lower perfusate hemoglobin levels were associated with a higher incidence of EAD and higher levels of liver injury markers. Maintaining higher hemoglobin levels during NMP may help reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury and prevent or attenuate EAD. Larger prospective studies are needed to validate the findings of this pilot study.","Maeda, A.; Starkey, G.; Spano, S.; Chaba, A.; Eastwood, G.; Yoshino, O.; Perini, M.

However, the limited number of suitable donors compared with the growing number of patients requiring LT remains a leading cause of mortality among those on the waiting list. This has resulted in the expansion of criteria for donor eligibility. The sequential combination of ex situ reperfusion, dHOPE, and NMP helps reduce the occurrence of ischemia-reperfusion injury and assess organ viability prior to transplantation. METHODS: This is a retrospective, single-arm, single-center study including all cases of liver grafts that underwent sequential perfusion between October 2021 and July 2024. Eligibility criteria for sequential perfusion were extended criteria DBD with macrosteatosis > 35%, use of high-dose vasopressors during donor ICU stay or episodes of cardiac arrest, hemodynamic instability during procurement, prolonged ischemia time for logistic reasons, as well as DCD showing prolonged fWIT, flow alteration during normothermic regional perfusion (NRP), and DCDs in Maastricht 2 class. Viability was assessed following the Groeningen group criteria. RESULTS: Thirty-three cases were included and 16 met the viability criteria at the end of the sequential perfusion and were transplanted. One patient developed an early allograft failure (EAF) and another a primary nonfunction (PNF). All the other patients had a regular postoperative course, with no retransplantation, 56% of the cohort showing no postoperative complication and all currently in good standing, median follow-up 19 months (range 4-39).

Curative-intent treatments offer the best long-term outcomes for selected patients. However, recurrence rates after resection approach 70% at 5 years, and access to transplantation remains limited by donor scarcity and stringent eligibility criteria. Emerging data reveal that recurrence is a reflection of underlying tumour biology, immune evasion and microenvironmental permissiveness. Advances in immunogenomic profiling, liquid biopsy and functional imaging are reshaping the concept of surgical eligibility, enabling biological risk stratification beyond conventional staging. At the same time, innovations in perioperative immunotherapy, graft preservation using machine perfusion and integrated multidisciplinary care are expanding the boundaries of curative treatment. These developments herald a shift from static criteria to dynamic, biology-driven paradigms that personalize surgical and transplant strategies. In this Review, we examine the evolving landscape of surgical treatment for HCC. We highlight the limitations of current selection frameworks, discuss how biological insights can inform resection and transplant decision-making and explore the role of perioperative and neoadjuvant therapies in reducing the recurrence of disease. Finally, we outline a future precision oncology model that integrates tumour genomics, immune phenotype and regenerative biology to improve outcomes in patients undergoing curative-intent treatment for HCC.","Malik, A.

However, the adoption of machine perfusion (MP) technologies has shown promise in improving deceased donor graft yield and utilization. To understand current use for patients with HCC, we examined liver transplant patterns with MP and the characteristics of patients with HCC receiving an MP liver. METHODS: Adult patients with HCC undergoing deceased donor liver transplant from September 29, 2021, to March 30, 2024, were identified using the United Network for Organ Sharing Standard Transplant Analysis and Research files. Patients were excluded if listed as status 1A or they underwent multiorgan or split liver transplant. Multivariate analysis compared patients with HCC receiving an MP liver with those receiving a static cold storage liver. RESULTS: Of 3774 liver recipients with HCC, 593 (15.7%) underwent transplant with an MP graft. Compared with patients donation after circulatory death graft receiving a graft with static cold storage preservation, those with MP had less advanced disease (ie, Child-Pugh class C cirrhosis 22.9% versus 29.9%, P < 0.01) and lower median match MELD (13 versus 17, P < 0.001). Tumor characteristics were similar between groups, including alpha-fetoprotein level, maximum tumor size, and locoregional treatments. Donor factors, and not tumor burden, were most predictive of receipt of an MP liver (donation after circulatory death graft: odds ratio [OR], 14.81; macrosteatosis >30%; OR, 3.85; donor age older than 60 y; OR, 2.34). A shorter waitlist time (6.5 versus 7.2 mo, P < 0.01), with similar 1-y patient survival (93.6% versus 93.2%, P = 0.82) and graft survival (92.0% versus 91.6%, P = 0.84), was also noted in patients undergoing MP transplant.

It remains unknown how the policy has impacted placement of these organs. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed United Network for Organ Sharing match run data, identifying livers offered from 21 March 2021 to 30 September 2023 with a bypass code indicating expedited placement. Bypass and standard allocation offers were examined with regards to organ quality, recipient outcomes, and placement patterns. RESULTS: A bypass code was used on 3,483 livers, of which 2,216 (69.4%) were ultimately transplanted. Expedited placement livers shared similar donor characteristics to standard allocation livers, but recipient demographics were distinct. Compared with matched standard allocation grafts, expedited placement livers demonstrated similar 1-year patient and graft survival rates. Notably, expedited placement livers were allocated to recipients significantly lower on the waitlist than recipients of matched standard allocation grafts (median rank 162.5 vs 16; P < .001). Seven organ procurement organizations (12.3%) contributed to nearly one-third of expedited placement grafts (701 livers), bypassing a median of 72 candidates per expedited placement attempt. Only 18 centers (15.6%) made up nearly 50% of expedited placement acceptances (1,109 livers). CONCLUSION: The new expedited placement policy resulted in efficient placement of select livers, achieving excellent 1-year outcomes. However, only a minority of centers benefit from use of these orphan livers.

In the current era of liver transplantation for unresectable hepatoblastoma with stable outcomes, it is challenging to choose extreme hepatectomy with hypothermic perfusion under total hepatic vascular exclusion. We herein report a successful case of extreme liver resection with in situ hypothermic perfusion. CASE PRESENTATION: A 10-month-old girl was referred for an unresectable hepatoblastoma (alpha-fetoprotein [AFP] 592037 ng/mL), approximately 12 cm in size, occupying the right lobe with a tumoral thrombus extending into the IVC toward the right atrium. The tumor continued to involve three hepatic veins and the IVC after intensive chemotherapy, which was categorized into POSTTEXT III (P1, V3, M0) staging. We planned an ante situm technique or in situ hypothermic perfusion to accomplish the complete removal of the large tumor and venous reconstruction. The adopted surgical technique was as follows: (1) hepatic partition on the line of extended right hepatectomy, including segment Iva; (2) mobilization of the suprahepatic IVC with tumor thrombi; (3) insertion of a cannula for hypothermic perfusion was from the stump of the right portal vein to the left lobe; (4) complete occlusion of the hepatic inflow following systemic heparinization with cutting the left hepatic vein and hypothermic perfusion with cold preservation solution using crushed ice; (5) complete tumor removal with the IVC tumoral thrombi; and (6) reconstruction of the IVC and left hepatic vein using an artificial vessel graft without requiring ante situm position, followed by reperfusion of the remnant liver. Time for cooling and preservation of the remaining liver in the body was 40 minutes, and time for IVC reconstruction was 21 minutes. The histological examination was margin-negative, and the AFP level was normalized. CONCLUSIONS: Resection of liver tumors invading the IVC or hepatic veins has become possible with technical lessons learned from liver transplantation skills. This procedure is a realistic option for achieving surgical cure and improving the quality of life in select pediatric patients with otherwise unresectable hepatoblastomas.","Matsuura, T.; Yanagi, Y.; Kawakubo, N.; Kajihara, K.; Shirai, T.; Uchida, Y.; Toriigahara, Y.; Yoshizumi, T.; Tajiri, T.",2025,Surg Case Rep,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ex vivo machine perfusion is a novel preservation technique for storing and assessing marginal kidney grafts. All ex vivo perfusion techniques have advantages and shortcomings. The current study analyzed whether a combination of oxygenated hypothermic machine perfusion (oxHMP) followed by a short period of normothermic ex vivo kidney perfusion (NEVKP) could combine the advantages of both techniques., Methods. Porcine kidneys were exposed to 30 min of warm ischemia followed by perfusion. Kidneys underwent either 16-h NEVKP or 16-h oxHMP. The third group was exposed to 16-h oxHMP followed by 3-h NEVKP (oxHMP + NEVKP group). After contralateral nephrectomy, grafts were autotransplanted and animals were followed up for 8 d., Results. All animals survived the follow-up period. Grafts preserved by continuous NEVKP showed improved function with lower peak serum creatinine and more rapid recovery compared with the other 2 groups. Urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, a marker of kidney injury, was found to be significantly lowered on postoperative day 3 in the oxHMP + NEVKP group compared with the other 2 groups., Conclusions. A short period of NEVKP after oxHMP provides comparable short-term outcomes to prolonged NEVKP and is superior to oxHMP alone. A combination of oxHMP with end-ischemic NEVKP could be an attractive, practical strategy to combine the advantages of both preservation techniques., Copyright (C) 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

402,,10.1097/TXD.0000000000001834,Is 2 h of Hypothermic Machine Perfusion for Pancreas Preservation Effective in Improving Graft Reperfusion?,"Background. Static cold storage (SCS) remains the standard method for organ preservation. The development of parenchymal edema during prolonged hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) was a major barrier to the introduction of this technique for the preservation of pancreases. A short period of HMP could optimize the pancreas for reperfusion while minimizing the side effects related to perfusion. Our objective is to evaluate the impact of short-term HMP on the pancreatic reperfusion., Methods. A preclinical study using a controlled donation after circulatory death porcine model was conducted. After procurement, the pancreases were preserved under hypothermic conditions for 2 h either by SCS (n = 4) or HMP (n = 4). After these 2 h of preservation, the pancreases were reperfused using a normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) for 2 h. During NMP, oxygenation, perfusion parameters, biochemical analyses, a glucose stimulation insulin secretion test, and an evaluation of ischemia/reperfusion injury by photoacoustic tomography were assessed., Results. During NMP, resistance indices were significantly lower in the HMP group compared with the SCS group, even after 2 h of reperfusion. The tissue oxygen partial pressure was higher throughout NMP after HMP preservation. Lactate and amylase levels were equal between the 2 groups. Lipase levels were higher in the HMP group. The glucose stimulation test showed no difference between the 2 groups. Photoacoustic tomography assessment showed no endothelial damage in either group., Conclusions. Our study suggests that a short-term HMP applied to pancreases for 2 h is effective in reducing resistance indexes and improving oxygenation., (C) 2025 The Authors.

The clinical standard for pancreas preservation for transplantation is static cold storage (SCS). Oxygenation during preservation has been shown to be advantageous in clinical studies. This study evaluates the efficiency of different oxygenation modalities during hypothermic pancreas preservation., Methods. Thirty-two porcine pancreases were procured in a controlled donation after circulatory death model and were divided to be preserved in 8 groups: (1) SCS, (2) hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP), (3) hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion (HOPE) with 21% oxygen, (4) HOPE and 100%, (5) SCS and oxygen carrier, M101, (6) HMP and M101, (7) HOPE 21% and M101, and (8) HOPE 100% and M101. All the groups underwent 24 h of hypothermic preservation, followed by 2 h of normothermic reperfusion. Oxygen partial pressures were assessed using parenchymal probes. Perfusion parameters, perfusate samples, and tissue biopsies were analyzed., Results. This study showed that HMP was linked to higher tissue oxygen partial pressures, lower succinate levels, and better reperfusion parameters. Furthermore, the addition of M101 to either SCS or HMP was associated with lower succinate and creatinine phosphokinase accumulation, suggesting a protective effect against ischemia., Conclusions. Our research has demonstrated the efficacy of machine perfusion in hypothermic conditions in providing oxygen to the pancreas during preservation and conditioning the pancreatic microvasculature for reperfusion during transplantation.

Under ischemic stress, multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) translocates from the hepatocyte membrane to the cytoplasm, resulting in loss of function. METHODS: We measured the cytoplasmic proportion of MRP2 (MRP2 internalization index, MII) by immunofluorescence colocalization analysis using CD13 as a canalicular membrane marker. RESULTS: The data showed that MII significantly correlated with ischemia time in both in situ ischemia-reperfusion injury and NMP rat models (R 2  = 0.331, P < 0.0001; R 2  = 0.632, P < 0.0001, respectively). Perfusate levels of liver injury markers at the end of NMP showed a significant positive correlation with MII for aspartate aminotransferase (R² = 0.444, P = 0.0013) and arginase 1 (R² = 0.637, P < 0.0001). Conversely, bile production exhibited a significant inverse correlation with MII (R² = 0.618, P < 0.0001). The maximum transport rate of MRP2 ( Vmax,MRP2 ), derived from kinetic modeling of sodium fluorescein biliary excretion, showed a significant inverse correlation with ischemia time (R 2  = 0.326, P = 0.0086) and MII (R 2  = 0.554, P = 0.0002). In human LT, MII values from donor liver biopsies preLT correlated significantly with peak postLT serum aminotransferase levels (R 2  = 0.398, P = 0.0007). CONCLUSIONS: MRP2 is a putative biomarker for the assessment of hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury. The biliary excretion kinetics of sodium fluorescein reflects MRP2-mediated transport activity, providing a novel diagnostic method for predicting liver graft viability after LT.","Monti, C.; Hong, S.

The introduction of normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) offers a platform for both extracorporeal organ maintenance and viability assessment, especially for organs with suspicious malfunction. These organs, discarded by the majority of transplant centers (so-called 'orphan livers'), may help to safely expand the donor pool thanks to pre-transplant appraisal; Methods: We identified all grafts undergoing normothermic ma-chine perfusions performed in the Department of General, Transplant, and Liver Surgery between December 2022 and August 2023. Their perfusion characteristics and immediate postoperative periods, as well as complications that occurred in the 90-day postoperative periods, were analyzed; Results: There were eight orphan liver grafts that underwent NMP in our Department. Postoperative complications occurring in patients receiving grafts after NMP did not seem associated with the procedure. One patient required laparotomy within the 90-day postoperative period due to biliary fistula and underwent bile duct stenting due to both fistula and nonanastomotic stricture. In one patient we observed the occurrence of anastomotic biliary stricture more than 90 days after LTx; Conclusions: NMP allows for the viability assessment of grafts with suspicious prepreservation malfunction. Some of these organs may help to expand the donor pool.","Morawski, M.; Zhylko, A.; Kubiszewski, H.; Rochoń, J.; Rykowski, P.; Staszewski, M.; Krasnodębski, M.; Figiel, W.; Krawczyk, M.; Grąt, M.",2025,J Clin Med,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to assess if end-ischemic dual hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion (dHOPE) is superior to static cold storage (SCS) in preservation of livers procured from DBD donors with respect to long-term outcomes. Existing data on short-term outcomes favours dHOPE in patients receiving high-risk grafts., Methods: This prospective randomized controlled trial included 104 recipients of DBD livers randomly assigned to SCS arm (78 patients) and the dHOPE arm (26 patients). Endpoints of interest were the occurrence of biliary complications (biliary fistula, anastomotic, and nonanastomotic strictures) and overall patient and graft survival (GS) during the 2-year follow-up., Results: A total of 36 patients developed biliary complications (at least one event) - six events in dHOPE arm and 30 in SCS arm. There was no significant difference in biliary complications between groups (23.7 vs. 43.4%, P=0.11). No differences were found significant with respect to anastomotic (19.9 vs. 33.7%, P=0.20) and nonanastomotic strictures (0 vs. 11.1%, P=0.10) as well as biliary fistulas (11.7 vs. 12.2%, P=0.93). Survival analysis did not show significantly different results in the study population - overall survival: 92.3% in dHOPE and 83.9% in SCS (P=0.35), and GS: 92.3 and 81.4% (P=0.23), respectively. However, a significant difference in GS was noted in recipients of high-risk grafts - 100% in dHOPE and 73.1% in SCS, respectively (P=0.038)., Conclusions: The long-term outcome data suggest that the routine use of dHOPE may be beneficial for recipients of high-risk grafts from DBD donors.

111,40202180.0,10.1097/mot.0000000000001221,Transplant oncology: an emerging field in cancer care,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Primary and secondary liver cancers are frequently unresectable at the time of diagnosis. Historically, these patients were treated with palliative therapy and no hope for curative resection. While liver transplant has been the standard of care for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), its indications have expanded to other oncologic indications based on promising data from select centers. This review focuses on the utilization of liver transplant for HCC, cholangiocarcinoma, and colorectal liver metastasis. RECENT FINDINGS: In the realm of HCC, immunotherapy is an emerging treatment that has the potential for use in the advanced and neoadjuvant setting. It can benefit patients by downstaging them to resectable or transplantable disease burden. Regarding cholangiocarcinoma, better molecular profiling and targeted therapies have benefited patients, and ongoing studies in the United States and internationally will help further delineate the patients with cholangiocarcinoma who benefit from transplantation. Finally, there is emerging evidence that liver transplant for colorectal liver metastases can be safe and effective. While there is promising data showing survival benefit of liver transplantation (LT) for CRLM, standardized guidelines and recommendations in coordination with multidisciplinary oncology teams will be essential for establishing best practices. SUMMARY: Similar to the evolution of LT becoming the standard of care for well selected patients with HCC, the evolution of the role for LT for other hepatobiliary malignancies is quickly progressing as centers in Europe, Asia, and North America gain experience and develop protocols for selected patients with favorable tumor biology. Optimal oncology treatment requires multidisciplinary tumor board and case-by-case approaches which are essential for providing these patients with the best chance at optimal survival.","Morris, M.

Hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE) improves outcomes of marginal liver grafts. However, to date, no preservation solution exists for both static cold storage (SCS) and HOPE., Methods. After 30 min of asystolic warm ischemia, porcine livers underwent 6 h of SCS followed by 2 h of HOPE. Liver grafts were either preserved with a single preservation solution (IGL2) designed for SCS and HOPE (IGL2-Machine Perfusion Solution [MPS] group, n = 6) or with the gold-standard University of Wisconsin designed for for SCS and Belzer MPS designed for HOPE (MPS group, n = 5). All liver grafts underwent warm reperfusion with whole autologous blood for 2 h, and surrogate markers of hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) were assessed in the hepatocyte, cholangiocyte, vascular, and immunological compartments., Results. After 2 h of warm reperfusion, livers in the IGL2-MPS group showed no significant differences in transaminase release (aspartate aminotransferase: 65.58 versus 104.9 UI/L/100 g liver; P = 0.178), lactate clearance, and histological IRI compared with livers in the MPS group. There were no significant differences in biliary acid composition, bile production, and histological biliary IRI. Mitochondrial and endothelial damage was also not significantly different and resulted in similar hepatic inflammasome activation., Conclusions. This preclinical study shows that a novel IGL2 allows for the safe preservation of marginal liver grafts with SCS and HOPE. Hepatic IRI was comparable with the current gold standard of combining 2 different preservation solutions (University of Wisconsin + Belzer MPS).

However, there is no consensus on best practices for VCA. This article discusses the common components, modifications, and considerations necessary for a successful VCA perfusion., Methods: A systematic literature review was performed in several databases (PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov) to identify articles published on VCA EVMP (face, limb, abdominal wall, uterus, penis, and free flaps) before August 2022. Graft type and animal model, general perfusion parameters, core components of the circuit, and optional components for enhanced monitoring were extracted from the articles., Results: A total of 1370 articles were screened, and 46 articles met inclusion criteria. Most articles (84.8%) were published in the last 10 years. Pigs were the main model used, but 10 protocols used human grafts. Free flaps were the most common graft type (41.3%), then upper extremities/forelimbs (28.3%), uteruses (17.4%), and hindlimbs (13.0%). Postperfusion replantation occurred in 15.2% of studies. Normothermic perfusion predominated (54.1%), followed by hypothermic (24.3%), and subnormothermic (21.6%). The majority of studies (87.0%) oxygenated their systems, most commonly with carbogen., Conclusions: EVMP is a rapidly growing area of research. Leveraging EVMP in VCA can optimize VCA procedures and allow for expansion into replantation, flap salvage, and other areas of plastic surgery.

150,38832856.0,10.1089/ten.TEA.2024.0048,Quality Assessment by Bile Composition in Normothermic Machine Perfusion of Rat Livers,"Background: The persistent challenge of organ scarcity in liver transplantation leads to an escalating dependence on organs obtained from extended criteria donors (ECD). Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) is used for improved preservation. Due to the mimicked in vivo conditions during normothermic machine perfusion, the liver is metabolically active, which allows quality assessment during perfusion. Bile seems to be of rising interest in clinical studies, as it is easily collectible for analysis. As there are currently no data on biliary bile acids during NMP, the primary objective of this study was to use our experimental rodent NMP model to assess changes in bile composition through organ damage during perfusion to inform clinical evaluation of donor organs during NMP. Methods: Thirty livers from male Sprague-Dawley rats in five groups underwent 6 h of NMP using either erythrocyte-supplemented DMEM or Steen solution, with or without 30 min of warm ischemia time (WIT). We conducted regular measurements of AST, ALT, LDH, and urea levels in the perfusate at 3-hour intervals. Bile samples were analyzed for biliary pH, LDH, and gamma glutamyltransferase, as well as biliary bile acids via mass spectrometry and UHPLC. Results: Compared with regular livers, liver injury parameters were significantly higher in our donation after circulatory death (DCD) model. Bile production was significantly reduced in livers exposed to WIT, and the bile showed a significantly more alkaline pH. This correlated with the concentration of total bile acids, which was significantly higher in livers experiencing WIT. However, regular livers produced a higher total amount of biliary bile acids during perfusion. Taurocholic acid and its metabolites were most prominent. Secondary bile acids were significantly reduced during perfusion due to the missing enterohepatic circulation. Conclusions: WIT-induced liver injury affects bile composition within our small-animal NMP model. We hypothesize this phenomenon to be attributed to the energy-driven nature of bile secretion, potentially explaining why DCD livers produce less, yet more concentrated, bile. Our results may inform clinical studies, in which biliary bile acids might have a potential as a quantifiable viability marker in human NMP liver transplantation studies.","Muth, V.; Strobl, F.; Michelotto, J.; Gilles, L.; Kirwan, J.

As there were no specific biomarkers for diagnosing PSC, we developed diagnostic criteria in 2016 based on cholangiography and elevated biliary enzymes. Novel findings and knowledge have subsequently accumulated, and we now propose the 2024 diagnostic criteria, to overcome several limitations of the 2016 diagnostic criteria. The Intractable Hepato-Biliary Diseases Study Group in Japan of the Committee of Research on Measures for Intractable Diseases established a working group consisting of experts in PSC comprising gastroenterologists, endoscopists, hepatologists, liver-transplant surgeons, pediatric hepatologists, pathologists, and radiologists. This working group proposed the 2024 diagnostic criteria after several discussions and public hearings. There are additional diagnostic targets; small duct PSC, pediatric PSC, and PSC recurrence following liver transplantation differ from the 2016 diagnostic criteria, which were for diagnosing large duct PSC in adults. The 2024 diagnostic criteria facilitate the use of magnetic resonance cholangiography in addition to endoscopic retrograde cholangiography in imaging, and incorporate gamma-glutamyl transferase for evaluating cholestasis to diagnose pediatric patients. Furthermore, PSC recurrence following liver transplantation can be diagnosed based on a liver biopsy and characteristic biliary findings. We hope that the 2024 diagnostic criteria will help not only hepatologists treating adults but also general physicians, pediatric hepatologists, and liver-transplant surgeons who manage patients with various forms of PSC.","Naitoh, I.; Isayama, H.; Akamatsu, N.; Mizuno, S.; Fujisawa, T.; Nakamoto, N.; Nakai, Y.; Umetsu, S.; Suzuki, M.; Yagi, S.; Haga, H.; Notohara, K.; Sano, K.; Tazuma, S.; Nakazawa, T.; Tanaka, A.",2025,J Gastroenterol,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite these advancements, acceptance of DCD livers from donors aged 60 y or older (DCD60) varies significantly among transplant centers. METHODS: This study analyzed data from the United Network for Organ Sharing database, encompassing 29 327 adult liver transplant candidates offered DCD60 grafts between October 2016 and June 2024. Among these, 704 offers were accepted, and 29 074 candidates received at least 1 DCD60 offer that was ultimately declined. Three-year intention-to-treat survival was measured from accept or decline until waitlist dropout or posttransplant death. RESULTS: At 3 y after initial decline of DCD60 livers, 53.8% received a transplant, 15.1% dropped off the waitlist, and 19.7% were removed for other reasons. Candidates who accepted DCD60 livers had significantly better 3-y intention-to-treat survival compared with those who declined (86.6% versus 74.9%, P < 0.001). In subgroup analyses, the survival benefit was significant for recipients older than 50 y and those with Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores ≥15 when the MELD score increased by 0 to 4 from listing to offer. CONCLUSIONS: Accepting DCD60 livers provides a clear survival benefit for appropriately selected candidates, and donor-recipient matching based on age and MELD score is crucial.","Nakayama, T.; Esquivel, C.

This is generally a positive trend. However, this might allow candidates with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the United States to receive LT without exception scores, for whom expedited transplant might not be ultimately beneficial. This study aimed to describe early transplant access and waitlist outcomes for candidates with HCC during the era after FDA approval of NMP. METHODS: Using the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database (2016-2023), 15,395 adult candidates listed for LT with HCC exceptions were divided into 3 listing periods: January 1, 2016, to May 18, 2019 (Delay and Cap); May 19, 2019, to September 27, 2021 (median Model for End-Stage Liver Disease at transplant minus 3); and September 28, 2021, to December 31, 2023 (NMP). Waitlist outcomes, including LT or dropout, were assessed using competing risk analysis. RESULTS: Transplant incidence within 6 months was 16.9% during the NMP era vs <12% in earlier eras (P <.001) thanks to aggressive use of extended criteria donors. Significant disparity in LT access among UNOS regions was observed. Of note, 1-year graft survival after LT remained high, exceeding 90.0% across all eras (P =.85). CONCLUSION: The NMP era demonstrated increased access to LT for candidates with HCC in the initial 6 months before qualifying for exception scores.","Nakayama, T.; Hall, K. A.; Wehrle, C.

Hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) represents a promising alternative to traditional static cold storage (SCS). METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed outcomes from 62 liver transplant recipients between 2016 and 2025, comparing 8 grafts preserved by HMP using the Liver Assist(®) system and 54 grafts preserved by SCS. Parameters assessed included postoperative complications, hemodynamic stability, ischemia times, and survival outcomes. RESULTS: HMP significantly reduced surgical (0% vs. 75.9%, p = 0.01) and biliary complications (0% vs. 34.4%, p = 0.004), improved hemodynamic stability post-reperfusion (∆MAP%: 1 vs. 21, p = 0.006), and achieved superior one-year survival rates (100% vs. 84.4%). Despite longer ischemia periods, grafts treated with HMP exhibited fewer adverse effects from ischemia-reperfusion injury. DISCUSSION: These findings highlight the substantial benefits of HMP, particularly in improving graft quality from marginal donors and reducing postoperative morbidity. Further adoption of this technology could significantly impact liver transplantation outcomes by expanding the viable donor pool. CONCLUSIONS: The study underscores the effectiveness of hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) as a superior preservation method compared to traditional static cold storage (SCS), HMP appears to be associated with improved short-term outcomes in liver transplantation. By substantially reducing postoperative complications and enhancing graft viability, HMP emerges as a pivotal strategy for maximizing the use of marginal donor organs. Further research and broader clinical implementation are recommended to validate these promising results and to fully harness the potential of HMP in liver transplantation.","Nastase, A.

Since the HIV Organ Policy Equity (HOPE) Act expands access to organs from donors with HIV, we assessed the impact of HOPE on LT rate and wait time for this population. We linked data from a multicenter HOPE in Action study to Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (February 21, 2019 to June 1, 2024) and used Poisson regression to compare transplant rates among 99 candidates willing to accept HOPE donors (HOPE candidates) to 13 495 candidates with or without HIV not listed as willing to accept HOPE donors (non-HOPE candidates) matched on transplant center. The median time to any deceased donor liver transplant (DDLT) was 2.3 months for HOPE and 1.1 years for non-HOPE candidates. Within 2 years of listing, 90.9% of HOPE versus 58.5% of non-HOPE candidates received a DDLT (P < .001). HOPE was associated with an overall 3.11-fold higher DDLT incident rate ratio (95% CI 2.48-3.88, P < .001). Stratified by model for end-stage liver disease score categories 6 to 14, 15 to 24, 25 to 34, and 35 to 40/status 1; HOPE candidates had 10.12-fold, 5.31-fold, 1.41-fold and 2.90-fold higher DDLT rates, respectively. Willingness to accept livers from donors with HIV improves access to liver transplantation for candidates with HIV.","Nauroz, Z.; Florman, S.; Rana, M. M.; Motter, J. D.; Price, J. C.; Mehta, S.

We hypothesized that there exist different biological subtypes of cGvHD. Using the ABLE network database, derived from the largest pediatric cGvHD cohort worldwide, we applied clustering analysis to subtype cGvHD patients from the ABLE1.0 and 2.0 studies (51 cGvHD patients, 158 non-cGvHD patients). We found three distinct cGvHD subtypes: cGvHD-1 was characterized by an effector memory (TEM), cytotoxic NK cell, and early precursor B cell predominant pattern; cGvHD-2 was phosphatidylcholine, cytokine, and plasma cells predominant; and cGvHD-3 had more naïve CD4+ T cell (TN) and naïve Treg, had later onset, and the only subtype with measurable TREC. We partially replicated these subtypes using metabolomic data from a separate pediatric cohort of the COG trial ASCT0031 (33 cGvHD patients, 39 non-cGvHD patients). Further, cGvHD-1 was associated with serotherapy (predominantly ATG) exposure, and cGvHD-3 was associated with receiving peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) from donors, total body irradiation (TBI), and no previous acute GvHD. cGvHD-2 was associated with liver involvement and cGvHD-2 and -3 with de novo cGvHD. Overall, none of the subtypes closely associated with organ involvement. Contrasting each subtype against non-cGvHD patients, the 3 subtypes shared common markers, all of which were used in our previous cGvHD diagnostic classifier. These findings suggest the presence of distinct biological subtypes of cGvHD that may help guide therapeutic strategies.","Ng, B.; Harris, A. C.; Abdossamadi, S.; Aubert, G.; Bajwa, R.

This study aimed to evaluate the haemodynamic conditions and histological changes of left lateral segment grafts (LLSG) during long-term normothermic machine perfusion (LT-NMP). METHODS: Human livers underwent LT-NMP and were split within 24 h of reperfusion into a LLSG and extended right graft (ERG). The LLSG consisted of segments 2 and 3, the coeliac trunk, left portal vein and left hepatic duct, to simulate a realistically-sized graft for clinical use. Vascular haemodynamic parameters, biochemical markers including endothelin-1 and histopathological signs of portal hyperperfusion injury were measured. RESULTS: Ten LLSGs were assessed. The median survival time was 5.7 days after splitting. LLSGs had higher portal venous resistance but similar weight-adjusted flow compared to ERGs. In the LLSGs, endothelin-1 levels remained low and there were no significant changes in histological signs of hyperperfusion injury over time. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first preclinical model to demonstrate that LT-NMP of LLSGs does not cause significant hyperperfusion injury. This opens the opportunity to expand the use of NMP to resuscitate marginal grafts in paediatric liver transplantation.","Niu, A.; Lau, N.

Active functional liver support, including detoxification, synthesis, and regulation, can improve lung preservation during EVLP. This study aimed to demonstrate the effects of hepatic conditioning of the EVLP perfusate on lung endothelium, via the receptor of advanced glycation end-products (RAGE)-nuclear-factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling in vitro. METHODS: we performed in vitro experiments using human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVECs), human hepatocytes, and perfusate (Steen solution). Four experimental groups: 1) fresh Steen (negative controls, NC), 2) EVLP'ed Steen control, this solution collected after 12 h of EVLP of human lungs, 3) hepatocyte conditioned EVLP'ed Steen (Hep-cond.), and 4) a RAGE inhibitor added in EVLP'ed Steen (RAGE inhibitor). HLMVECs were incubated in each testing condition and exposed to hypoxia (1% O(2)/8% CO(2)) for 24 h. Media were collected to investigate NF-κB signaling and endothelial glycocalyx damage. RESULTS: HLMVECs incubated under hypoxia in EVLP'ed Steen showed significantly upregulated NF-κB signal and endothelial damage denoted by increased glycosaminoglycans and matrix metalloproteinase-2 activity among the groups. The Hep-cond. solution significantly attenuated those findings, while the RAGE inhibitor attenuated the NF-κB signal but not endothelial glycocalyx damage. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that hepatic function incorporated into EVLP can ameliorate pulmonary endothelial cells injury under hypoxic normothermic perfusion exposure. Our data supports the concept of incorporating other organ functions into an organ perfusion platform, to enhance lung graft preservation.","Noda, K.; Atale, N.; Austin, T.; Geller, D.

Although lactate clearance during NMP has been associated with graft outcomes, its dynamic patterns and relationship with posttransplant biliary complications (PTBCs) remain poorly understood. We sought to evaluate whether dynamic lactate clearance patterns during NMP could predict PTBCs in both donations after circulatory death (DCD) and brain death (DBD) liver transplantation (LT). METHODS: We conducted a single-center retrospective study of 140 LT recipients (88 DCDs, 52 DBDs) undergoing NMP (2022-2024). K-means clustering analysis was applied to lactate clearance patterns during the first 3 h of NMP. The primary outcome was PTBCs. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors for PTBC. RESULTS: K-means clustering revealed 3 distinct patterns: consistently low (cluster A), rapid clearance (cluster B), and prolonged elevation (cluster C). DCD grafts demonstrated more pronounced differences in lactate clearance and higher rates of persistent elevation than DBD grafts. For DCD grafts, the distribution was cluster A (26.1%, n = 23), cluster B (37.5%, n = 33), and cluster C (36.4%, n = 32), whereas DBD grafts showed cluster A (55.8%, n = 29), cluster B (17.3%, n = 9), and cluster C (26.9%, n = 14). In DCD grafts, PTBC rates were significantly higher in cluster C (37.5%) than in clusters A (13.0%, P = 0.045) and B (15.2%, P = 0.04). This association remained significant in multivariate analysis (adjusted odds ratio, 4.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-21.9; P = 0.045). No differences in recipient or donor variables were observed across clusters. Among DBD grafts, no intercluster differences in PTBC rates were found. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic lactate clearance patterns during NMP predict PTBCs in DCD LT. This novel approach may enable more precise risk stratification and guide posttransplant surveillance strategies for DCD grafts.","Obana, A.; Akabane, M.; Chi, H.; Ladd, N.; Nguyen, A.; Tan, L.

Advances in perfusion techniques, such as the normothermic machine perfusion pump, offer advantages over traditional static cold storage by maintaining organ viability during prolonged periods. We report the first successful combined heart-liver transplant using normothermic machine perfusion for both organs from a donation after circulatory death donor. The recipient is a 45-year-old male with ischemic cardiomyopathy-induced heart failure and end-stage liver disease secondary to congestive hepatopathy. Both organs, procured from a donation after circulatory death donor were preserved on the TransMedics Organ Care System and subsequently transplanted with total post crossclamp times of 7.75 hours for the heart and 15.25 hours for the liver. At 8 months post-transplant, the patient demonstrates stable cardiac and hepatic graft function. This case highlights the critical role of normothermic machine perfusion in optimizing organ quality and mitigating ischemic injury in multi-organ transplants involving donation after circulatory death donors. Our findings support the expanded use of normothermic machine perfusion to enhance organ utilization, particularly in complex, high-risk multi-organ transplants cases.","Ohara, S.

However, the TransMedics Organ Care System (OCS) permits only single hepatic artery (HA) cannulation, limiting its use in grafts with variant arterial anatomy. Arterial reconstruction before NMP may overcome this limitation and expand the pool of grafts eligible for perfusion. We conducted a retrospective single-center cohort study of adult liver transplants utilizing OCS from January 2022 to September 2024. Allografts with variant hepatic artery anatomy requiring arterial reconstruction before NMP initiation were identified. Postoperative outcomes, including vascular and biliary complications, were compared between reconstructed and non-reconstructed grafts. Among 541 OCS-preserved grafts, 74 (13.7%) underwent arterial reconstruction. Compared with non-reconstructed grafts, reconstructed grafts had longer cross-clamp to cannulation time (2.8 vs. 2.4 h, p <0.001), but similar rates of early allograft dysfunction (23.0% vs. 20.8%, p =0.65), ischemic cholangiopathy (4.1% vs. 4.1%, p =1.00), and primary nonfunction (0.0% vs. 0.4%, p =1.00). Early (2.7% vs. 0.2%, p =0.05) and late hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) (4.1% vs. 2.1%, p =0.40) were infrequent and not significantly different between non-reconstructed and reconstructed groups, respectively. Hepatic artery stenosis occurred more often in reconstructed grafts (12.2% vs. 4.1%, p =0.008), though most cases were managed with interventional radiology or surgical revision. Only one reconstructed graft required retransplantation due to vascular complications. Arterial reconstruction before NMP is safe and feasible, enabling successful perfusion and transplantation of liver allografts with variant HA anatomy. These findings support the broader application of NMP in anatomically complex donor livers.","Ohara, S. Y.; Li, X.; Ruch, B.; Nunez-Nateras, R.; Zhang, N.; Cosentino, C. P.; Mirie, K. R.; Hewitt, W.

It has been reported that the normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) technique was associated with lower rates of IC. However, the effect of NMP on anastomotic biliary complications remains unclear. METHODS: A total of 450 LTs performed between January 2019 and December 2023 were analyzed in a retrospective study. The primary outcome included biliary complications within 180 d after LT and those classified by type (bile leak, stricture, or IC). Risk factors for biliary complications were compared between the NMP group and the non-NMP group within both the DBD and DCD groups. RESULTS: The incidence of IC was higher in the DCD without NMP group at 17.5% (10/57), compared with the DCD with NMP group (0%). DCD was independently associated with the development of biliary complications by all causes after LT (odds ratio, 2.29 [95% confidence interval, 1.29-4.07], P < 0.01), whereas NMP did not reduce the risk of biliary complications by all causes (odds ratio, 0.54 [confidence interval, 0.29-1.02], P = 0.06). NMP also did not reduce the risk of biliary anastomotic complications, excluding IC in either DBD or DCD groups. CONCLUSIONS: Although NMP might prevent IC, it did not reduce the risk of biliary complications regardless of donor type. Blood circulation to the biliary system may not be adequate, leading to anastomotic biliary complications.","Oki, R.; Kerby, E.; Rocha, I.; Al-Juburi, S.; Miyake, K.; Polanco, G.; Orellana, J.; Ephraim, D.; Mohamed, A.; Al-Kurd, A.; Nassar, A.; Yoshida, A.; Abouljoud, M.; Nagai, S.",2025,Transplant Direct,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed 6,956 SLKT performed between 2015 and 2024 using the United Network for Organ Sharing database. The primary outcomes were the 1-year graft survival for kidney and liver. Donor types and MP use for liver and/or kidney were captured and associations with outcomes were evaluated. SLKT from Donation after circulatory death donors (DCD) increased from 4.5% in 2015 to 16% in 2023. The median Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI) has increased from 23% in 2015 to 28% in 2023.

AIM: To assess NMP utilization in liver transplant (LT) practices. METHODS: All adult deceased-donor LT recipients between January 2021 and September 2023 in the United States were analyzed. Outcomes including discard rates, survival, preservation time and timing of surgery were compared between two groups: NMP vs non-NMP. RESULTS: Between 2021 and 2023, NMP was utilized in 1493 (6.3%) of all LTs in the United States. Compared to non-NMP group, NMP group had lower allograft discard rate (6.5% vs 10%, P < 0.001), older recipients' age (median: 47 vs 42 years, P < 0.001), and higher utilization of donors from donation after circulatory death (DCD) (55% vs 11%, P < 0.001). NMP group also had longer distances between recipient and donor hospitals (median: 156 vs 138 miles, P < 0.001), longer preservation time (median: 12.2 vs 5.8 hours, P < 0.001), and more daytime reperfusion (74% vs 55%, P < 0.001). Post-transplant survival outcomes were comparable between the two groups. In a subgroup analysis of NMP, recipients in the long preservation time (≥ 8 hours) group had higher daytime reperfusion (78% vs 55%, P < 0.001) and similar post-transplant survival when compared to the short preservation time (< 8 hours) group. CONCLUSION: The utilization of NMP is associated with lower discard rates and increased DCD organs for LT. NMP allows for prolonging the preservation time and increased occurrence of daytime LT, without any impact on the survival outcomes.","Okumura, K.; Dhand, A.; Hasjim, B.

Use of normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) may help to expand the liver transplantation (LT) donor pool by potentially increasing the utilization of donation after circulatory death (DCD) organs. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of NMP on LT from DCD organs., Methods. Data among DCD adult LT recipients in the United Network for Organ Sharing between January 2016 and December 2022 were analyzed. Outcomes were compared between 2 groups: NMP versus non-MP using propensity score matching., Results. During the study period, 4217 DCD LT recipients (NMP: 257 and non-MP: 3960) were identified. compared with non-MP, DCD LT recipients in NMP group were older (median recipient age: 61 versus 59 y, P = 0.013), had lower model for the end-stage liver disease score, longer wait time (126 versus 107 d, P = 0.028), and received organs from older donors (median age: 42 versus 38 y, P < 0.01) with longer preservation time (9.9 versus 5.3 h, P < 0.001). Two-year overall survival (NMP 94.4% versus non-MP 89.7%, P = 0.040) and 2-y graft survival (NMP 91.3% versus non-MP 84.6%, P = 0.017) were better in the NMP group. After propensity score matching, 2-y overall survival (NMP 94.2% versus non-MP 88.0%, P = 0.023) and graft survival (NMP 91.3% versus non-MP 81.6%, P = 0.004) were better in the NMP group.

However, 30% of DCD liver grafts procured for transplantation are not utilized. Barriers to DCD liver utilization include quality concerns, particularly the risk of ischemic cholangiopathy and retransplantation, and costs associated with DCD organ acquisition. This study investigated the attitudes of the liver transplantation community in the US toward DCD and identified barriers to DCD liver utilization. METHODS: RedCap survey of liver transplantation surgical directors in the US. RESULTS: Of 101 liver transplantation surgical directors, 24 responded to the survey, and 96% of respondents accepted DCD donors. Most programs accepted livers from thoracoabdominal normothermic regional perfusion with cold storage (96%), while substantially fewer accepted liver grafts from rapid recovery DCD donors with cold storage (67%). Sixty-five percent of transplant centers' functional warm ischemic time started when oxygen saturation or systolic blood pressure was <80%/mm Hg; 13% started at extubation, 17.4% started at systolic blood pressure <80 mm Hg, and 4.3% used a systolic blood pressure <50 mm Hg. CONCLUSION: We found variability among transplant programs in DCD liver graft acceptance based on procuring surgeon, procurement technique, and storage modality. Quality and cost are two main barriers to DCD liver utilization, with the main tradeoffs being between rapid recovery with static cold storage (lower cost, lower quality) and machine perfusion/normothermic regional perfusion (higher cost, better quality).","Otajonova, N.; Martinez, E.

Subnormothermic machine perfusion shows promise as a viable alternative to static cold storage for prolonged preservation of vascularized composite allografts. To date, most studies have been conducted in nonprimate models, and we report its first utilization in a cynomolgus forearm preclinical model for 24-h preservation., Methods. Forearms were procured from nonhuman primates weighing between 5 and 8 kg. Two perfusion protocols were implemented. In group 1 (n = 6), limbs were perfused with 1.5 L of recirculating Steen; the perfusate flow was adjusted to maintain stable vascular pressures. In group 2 (n = 6), limbs were perfused with a Steen+ solution, doubling the albumin concentration, with a full-volume exchange at mid-perfusion under a stable low-flow regimen. Dynamic and metabolic parameters, histological analysis, and response to neurostimulation were assessed., Results. After 24 h of continuous perfusion, mean weight gain was 24.8 +/- 5.5% in group 1 and 8.0 +/- 4.7% in group 2. Perfusion and metabolic parameters indicated the onset of a compartment syndrome in group 1 with an increase in resistance, lactate, and potassium production at mid-perfusion. In group 2, dynamic and metabolic parameters remained stable for 24 h, and histological analysis showed well-preserved tissues. Finally, in group 2, limbs exhibited muscular contraction recovery quantified at 2.4/5 +/- 0.89 after 24 h compared with 0/5 after 3 h of ischemia or after perfusion in group 1., Conclusions. Successful 24-h perfusion and muscle contractility restoration demonstrate promising outcomes for vascularized composite allograft preservation and reconditioning., (C) 2025 The Authors.

Hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion (HMP-O2) has shown benefits compared to static cold storage (SCS) by limiting ischemia-reperfusion injury. This study reports outcomes using a novel portable HMP-O2 device in the first US randomized control trial., Approach and Results: The PILOT trial (NCT03484455) was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, noninferiority trial, with participants randomized to HMP-O2 or SCS. HMP-O2 livers were preserved using the Lifeport Liver Transporter and Vasosol perfusion solution. The primary outcome was early allograft dysfunction. Noninferiority margin was 7.5%. From April 3, 2019, to July 12, 2022, 179 patients were randomized to HMP-O2 (n=90) or SCS (n=89). The per-protocol cohort included 63 HMP-O2 and 73 SCS. Early allograft dysfunction occurred in 11.1% HMP-O2 (N=7) and 16.4% SCS (N=12). The risk difference between HMP-O2 and SCS was -5.33% (one-sided 95% upper confidence limit of 5.81%), establishing noninferiority. The risk of graft failure as predicted by Liver Graft Assessment Following Transplant score at seven days (L-GrAFT7) was lower with HMP-O2 [median (IQR) 3.4% (2.4-6.5) vs. 4.5% (2.9-9.4), p=0.024]. Primary nonfunction occurred in 2.2% of all SCS (n=3, p=0.10). Biliary strictures occurred in 16.4% SCS (n=12) and 6.3% (n=4) HMP-O2 (p=0.18). Nonanastomotic biliary strictures occurred only in SCS (n=4)., Conclusions: HMP-O2 demonstrates safety and noninferior efficacy for liver graft preservation in comparison to SCS. Early allograft failure by L-GrAFT7 was lower in HMP-O2, suggesting improved early clinical function. Recipients of HMP-O2 livers also demonstrated a lower incidence of primary nonfunction and biliary strictures, although this difference did not reach significance., Copyright (C) 2024 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.","Panayotova, G.; Lunsford, K.; Quillin, R.; Rana, A.; Agopian, V.; Lee-Riddle, G.; Markovic, D.; Paterno, F.; Griesemer, A.; Amin, A.; Alonso, D.; Rocca, J.; Borja-Cacho, D.; Hernandez-Alejandro, R.; Fung, J.; Pelletier, S.; Shah, S.; Guarrera, J.",2024,Hepatology,EMBASE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, further improvements are needed to refine outcomes in non-vaccine, extrahepatic applications, such as minimizing the rapid clearance and off-target uptake in undesired tissues of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS). We propose modifying LNP surfaces with the phagocytic cell ""don't eat me"" signal, CD47, in combination with our previously established antibody-based targeted LNP (tLNP) to create a CD47/tLNP platform with reduced phagocytic clearance and off-target effects and improved efficiency for cell-specific delivery. We showed that CD47 modification decreased macrophage and hepatic uptake both in vitro and in vivo. Combining CD47 modification with antibodies targeting endothelial cells, T cells, or hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) increased targeting efficiency up to 3-fold compared to tLNP alone. Enhanced targeting of CD47/tLNP to HSCs with reduced off-targeting enabled the delivery of pro-apoptotic mRNA for HSC depletion as a preconditioning strategy prior to bone marrow transplant. Additionally, CD47-modified LNPs showed diminished inflammatory effects on hepatic tissue and an altered protein corona. Our CD47/tLNP-mRNA platform, with its reduced phagocytic clearance, mitigated inflammatory effects, and enhanced targeted delivery, should further facilitate the development of in vivo mRNA therapeutics.","Papp, T.

371,,10.1097/LVT.0000000000000381,Efficiency of machine perfusion in pediatric liver transplantation,"Liver transplantation is the only life-saving procedure for children with end-stage liver disease. The field is however heterogenic with various graft types, recipient age, weight, and underlying diseases. Despite recently improved overall outcomes and the expanded use of living donors, waiting list mortality remains unacceptable, particularly in small children and infants. Based on the known negative effects of elevated donor age, higher body mass index, and prolonged cold ischemia time, the number of available donors for pediatric recipients is limited. Machine perfusion has regained significant interest in the adult liver transplant population during the last decade. Ten randomized controlled trials are published with an overall advantage of machine perfusion techniques over cold storage regarding postoperative outcomes, including graft survival. The concept of hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE) was the first and only perfusion technique used for pediatric liver transplantation today. In 2018 the first pediatric candidate received a full-size graft donated after circulatory death with cold storage and HOPE, followed by a few split liver transplants after HOPE with an overall limited case number until today. One series of split procedures during HOPE was recently presented by colleagues from France with excellent results, reduced complications, and better graft survival. Such early experience paves the way for more systematic use of machine perfusion techniques for different graft types for pediatric recipients. Clinical reports of pediatric liver transplants with other perfusion techniques are awaited. Strong collaborative efforts are needed to explore the effect of perfusion techniques in this vulnerable population impacting not only the immediate posttransplant outcome but the development and success of an entire life., Copyright (C) 2024 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.","Parente, A.; Kasahara, M.; De Meijer, V.; Hashimoto, K.; Schlegel, A.",2024,Liver transplant.,EMBASE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pancreas transplantation is one of the most effective treatment options for individuals diagnosed with complicated diabetes. However, the pancreas has one of the strictest acceptance criteria and the highest discard rate of any organ after retrieval. Normothermic ex vivo perfusion (NEVP) has emerged as a promising strategy to evaluate and potentially improve the quality of pancreatic grafts before transplantation., Methods. Using a porcine model of pancreas transplantation, we compared 5 h of static cold storage (SCS; n = 4) with 2 h of SCS followed by 3 h of NEVP (n = 4). Parameters such as graft hemodynamics, blood biochemistry, and histopathology were evaluated. The animals were followed up for 3 d after transplantation., Results. A glucose tolerance test performed on day 3 was comparable between the 2 groups (P = 0.71). The NEVP group exhibited a significantly lower number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling-positive cells compared with the SCS group (P = 0.01). Additionally, plasma and tissue levels of 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine were significantly lower in the NEVP group on postoperative day 3 compared with the SCS group (P = 0.01). However, within-group comparisons did not show statistically significant changes over time., Conclusions. This study demonstrates that the addition of NEVP significantly reduces apoptosis after reperfusion and may help stabilize oxidative stress levels.

Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) allows a functional assessment of marginal organs using biochemical parameters. This study describes the histological changes in livers undergoing NMP. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 170 biopsies taken pre-NMP, after 4 h of NMP, end-NMP and at implantation from 50 livers undergoing NMP as part of standard local transplant practice were retrospectively reviewed. Thirty-eight per cent had large droplet macrovesicular steatosis pre-NMP, which was associated with reduced organ utilisation, P = 0.096, subsequent extracellular fat and a neutrophilic reaction; 32% had small droplet macrovesicular steatosis pre-NMP suggestive of acute cellular stress, the severity of which was unchanged in 64% during the perfusion period. Those showing at least moderate hepatocellular necrosis at end-NMP were less likely to be transplanted (55 versus 24%, P = 0.0505). Variation in the extent of hepatocyte necrosis was seen between biopsies, with 43% of transplanted cases showing less hepatocyte necrosis at implantation compared to end-NMP and 21% more severe necrosis. Patchy portal inflammation was present in 96% of pre-NMP biopsies, although identifiable duct injury was rare and portal thrombi were not identified. Sinusoidal dilation pre-NMP was more frequent in donation after circulatory death donors, typically persisted during NMP although had improved by implantation in most and had resolved in cases with an early post-transplant biopsy. CONCLUSIONS: Histological changes in NMP livers predominantly comprise donor-derived steatosis, stress-associated small droplet steatosis, retrieval- and procedure-associated sinusoidal dilation and ischaemic injury.","Paterson, A.

41,39895504.0,10.1111/aor.14941,"Long-Term Liver Machine Perfusion Preservation: A Review of Recent Advances, Benefits and Logistics","BACKGROUND: The global shortage of suitable donor livers for transplantation has prompted efforts to expand the donor pool by using extended criteria donors. Machine preservation technology has shown promise in optimizing graft preservation and improving logistics. Additionally, it holds potential for organ repair, regeneration, therapeutic applications during extended preservation periods, and enhancing organ allocation. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature review using PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases. All studies published between January 1, 2022, and February 7, 2024, that described machine perfusion preservation of livers for more than 24 h were eligible for inclusion. The findings were synthesized in a narrative review format to highlight key benefits and advancements. RESULTS: We identified eleven studies from multiple research groups, employing various techniques, devices, and preservation durations. Perfusion durations ranged from 1 to 13 days, with notable variations in protocols for long-term preservation beyond 24 h. Viability was assessed during perfusion only. No livers were transplanted. Among the reviewed studies, the introduction of a dialysis system emerged as the most effective strategy for managing waste accumulation during long-term liver perfusion. Differences were also observed in hemodynamics, oxygenation, organ chambers, supplemental regimens, and glycemic control. CONCLUSION: Over the past two years, substantial progress has been made in refining protocols for long-term liver machine perfusion, with significant advancements in waste management, enabling successful multi-day perfusions. While these developments are promising, further research is necessary to standardize and optimize long-term perfusion protocols, establishing a reliable platform for both organ preservation and therapeutic applications.","Pavan-Guimaraes, J.; Devos, L.; Lascaris, B.; de Meijer, V.

Here, the authors aim to evaluate whether perfusion via portal vein alone (sHOPE) or via additional perfusion of the hepatic artery (dHOPE) have diverging impact on outcomes after OLT when compared to the use of static cold storage (SCS)., Methods: Consecutive patients undergoing OLT at the Medical University of Vienna (2018-2023) were retrospectively analyzed. Donor organs were procured using SCS, or subjected to end-ischemic sHOPE or dHOPE. The severity of biliary complications was classified according to the degree of therapeutic intervention (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or surgical revision)., Results: Two hundred forty-seven patients were included (69 SCS, 76 sHOPE, and 102 dHOPE). Hospitalization was shorter for patients after HOPE (median in days: SCS=25 vs HOPE=20, P=0.019). Biliary complications were less frequent in patients after HOPE (SCS=37.7% vs HOPE=22.5%, P=0.015). A significantly lower incidence of surgical revisions for biliary complications was observed in the HOPE cohort (24.6% vs 11.8%, P=0.012). When evaluating outcome according to HOPE-modality, a significant reduction in biliary complications (P=0.006) and surgical revisions (P=0.002) was only observed in dHOPE patients in comparison to SCS. Further, only dHOPE was significantly associated with a reduced need for surgical revision for biliary complications upon univariable and multivariable logistic regression (odds ratio=0.336, P=0.011)., Conclusion: HOPE leads to a reduction of biliary complications and associated surgical revisions. This effect seems to be primarily associated with use of dHOPE, while both methods appear as feasible options for preconditioning of donor grafts prior to OLT., (C) 2024 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.","Pereyra, D.; Dingfelder, J.; Riha, M.; Kacar, S.; Rauter, L.; Becker, N.; Saffarian Zadeh, T.; Tortopis, C.; Starlinger, P.; Ristl, R.; Silberhumer, G.; Salat, A.; Soliman, T.; Berlakovich, G.; Gyoeri, G.",2024,Int J Surg,EMBASE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many studies reported their good outcomes but their use is debated due to increased risk of complications. Ex situ liver perfusion has reduced graft discard rate and helped to test their function before implantation. Cytokines are known to be involved in ischemia-reperfusion injury, but their potential to predict liver function during normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) has not been fully investigated. The aim of this study was to compare cytokines levels during NMP in 3 different types of donors (donation after brain death, donation after circulatory death [DCD]-II, DCD-III) and correlate these data to postoperative clinical and biochemical outcomes. All donations after brain deaths older than 70 years and DCDs transplanted after NMP were included. IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-[alpha] were measured during NMP and correlated with clinical outcomes. Thirty liver grafts were transplanted after NMP: 16 donations after brain deaths, 7 DCD-II, and 7 DCD-III. There were 6 cases of early allograft dysfunction (20.0%), 10 of post-reperfusion syndrome (33.3%), and 11 cases of acute kidney injury (36.7%), with no major differences among groups. A positive correlation was found between perfusate IL-6 levels and the bilirubin peak within 7 days after liver transplantation, while IL-10 was associated with the intensive care unit stay and TNF-[alpha] to the international normalized ratio peak within 7 days. IL-6 was negatively associated with postoperative ALT levels and IL-10 to bilirubin peak. A correlation between higher IL-6 levels at 2 hours and graft loss was found. This is the first study to compare cytokines profile during NMP in 3 different types of donors and correlate it to clinical outcomes.

While advances in transplant practice have improved cancer-specific outcomes, multiple and debilitating long term physical and psychologic effects remain. Patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) are often critically ill at initial diagnosis and with necessary sequential treatments become increasingly frail and deconditioned. Despite modern treatment regimens and support, cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of non-relapse mortality among allo-BMT survivors. Well-established multi-disciplinary care models such as cardiac rehabilitation offer holistic care including exercise training, nursing support, physical/occupational therapy, psychosocial support and nutritional education. HSCT patients may be excluded from conventional outpatient physical rehabilitation programs due to prolonged pancytopenia and frequent hospital admissions. In Canada, dedicated cancer-specific rehabilitation programs are available only at major tertiary academic centers. METHODS: The primary aim of this study will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a multimodal care navigation (nursing, exercise, nutrition) intervention with content delivery facilitated by a supportive care web-based 'app' extending from diagnosis to 1 year in the allogeneic bone marrow transplant population. Adult patients scheduled for allo-BMT will receive support from exercise specialist, nursing support and dietician expertise alongside a supportive care 'app' with additional in-person or virtual cardiac rehabilitation support. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, no research team is taking such a holistic, multidisciplinary approach to address the debilitating physiologic and psychological consequences of allo-BMT. We expect the findings to inform the optimal timing and patient preferences to develop studies examining risk-specific, individualized interventions (including exercise, pharmacotherapy, combination treatments) to reduce or prevent symptoms and dysfunction. We expect this innovative program to identify ways to benefit innumerable patients with hematologic and other malignancies. Ultimately, we hope to transform supportive care in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT05579678.","Pituskin, E.; Foulkes, S.; Skow, R.

As part of a Controversies Conference addressing the evaluation and management of infectious diseases (ID) in deceased donors sponsored by the American Society of Transplantation (AST), two online pre-meeting surveys were developed to inform conference proceedings and assess current practices and opinions on donor screening and antimicrobial management. METHODS: Survey 1 addressed the current state of deceased donor ID testing, culture data communication, antimicrobial utilization, and involvement of transplant ID during donor management and was distributed to all 56 United States OPOs. Survey 2 evaluated transplant professionals' opinions regarding donor antimicrobial use and was sent to the AST Infectious Disease, Kidney Pancreas, Liver and Intestinal, and Thoracic and Critical Care Community of Practice listservs. Descriptive statistics were performed. RESULTS: Thirty-five (63%) unique responses were received from OPOs for Survey 1. Findings included variability in the timing of donor culture collection, frequent sampling of indwelling catheters, wide variation in the location of culture processing, and availability of additional susceptibility testing. Eighty-eight unique responses were received from approximately 1552 (6%) transplant providers for Survey 2. Of the respondents, 37% would not recommend standard antibiotics prior to organ recovery in the absence of suspected or confirmed infection. CONCLUSIONS: These surveys demonstrate variability in donor testing, donor antimicrobial utilization, and transplant provider opinions regarding the need for and selection of antimicrobial agents. Findings highlight opportunities for standardized approaches to donor testing and management.","Pouch, S. M.; Anesi, J. A.; Pruett, T.; Harmon, M.; Dionne, S. O.; Hasz, R.; La Hoz, R.

PRS can impact the short-term and long-term patient and graft outcomes. The definition of PRS has evolved over the years, from changes in arterial blood pressures and heart and/or decreases in the systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output to including the fibrinolysis and grading the severity of PRS. However, all that did not reflect on the management of PRS or its impact on the outcomes. In recent years, new scientific techniques and new technology have been in the pipeline to better understand, manage and maybe prevent PRS. These new methods and techniques are still in the infancy, and they have to be proven not in prevention and management of PRS but their effects in the patient and graft outcomes. In this article, we will review the long history of PRS, its definition, etiology, management and most importantly the new advances in science and technology to prevent and properly manage PRS.","Puchany, A.

Retrospective data of all DCD LTs performed at our center between August 19, 2022, and May 31, 2024, were analyzed. The OrganOx metra device, back-to-base, was used for NMP at our center. United Network for Organ Sharing data were used to present national DCD LT volumes and waitlist outcomes., Results. Sixty-seven NMP and 44 static cold storage transplants were performed. In the NMP group, donors were older (50 versus 45 y, P = 0.0260), were at increased risk (US donor risk index 2.43 versus 2.12, P = 0.006), incidence of early allograft dysfunction (42% versus 75%, P = 0.0008) and postreperfusion syndrome (25% versus 48%, P = 0.0239) was lower, and recipients had better native kidney function at 3 mo (estimated glomerular filtration rate 73 versus 62 mL/min/1.73 m2, P = 0.0205).

Normothermic regional perfusion (NRP) and normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) are techniques that mitigate ischemic injury and associated complications. In this single-center retrospective study, we compared early transplant outcomes of DCD livers undergoing direct procurement (DP) and static cold storage (SCS) (DCD-DP-SCS), NRP procurement with SCS (DCD-NRP-SCS), or DP with NMP (DCD-DP-NMP). Two hundred thirty-eight DCD liver recipients were evaluated, comprising 59 DCD-DP-SCS, 101 DCD-NRP-SCS, and 78 DCD-DP-NMP. Overall, the PRS incidence was 19%. DCD-DP-SCS had a higher incidence of PRS (37%; P < .001), AKI stage ≥2 (47%; P = .033), and an increased model for early allograft function score (P < .001). In adjusted multivariate analysis, recipient age (odds ratio [OR] 1.10, 95% CI 1.05-1.17; P < 0.001), and normothermic perfusion (DCD-NRP-SCS: OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.06-0.39; P < .001; DCD-DP-NMP: OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.15-0.91; P = .032) were significant predictors of PRS, which itself was associated with worse 5-year transplant survival (graft survival non-censored-to-death; Hazard ratio (HR) 2.9, 95% CI 1.3-6.7; P = .012).

Here, we tried to determine the role of chemo agents in mediating the stress induced pathways like autophagy and unfolded protein responses (UPR), as well as the migratory potential of NCSCs. hEPI-NCSCs were treated with chemo agents including Dithiothreitol [(DTT) 10µM)], Salinomycin (9mM), Ebselen (10mM), 5-Fluorouracil [(5-FU) 8µM] and Cisplatin (6mM) for 72 hours. The reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT- qPCR) and scratch wound healing assays were used to assess the effect of chemo agents on NCSCs function. After treatment with DTT, hEPI-NCSCs upregulated the expression of genes related to autophagy and UPR pathways including LC3, P62 and CHOP. These genes were also overexpressed when NCSCs were treated with Salinomycin. Reverse results were verified by 5-FU, Ebselen and Cisplatin treatment. Salinomycin and Cisplatin upregulated the expression of XBP-1, which down regulated with DTT, 5-FU and Ebselen. Inhibition in migratory capacity of NCSCs was detected following treatment by Salinomycin, 5-FU, Ebselen and Cisplatin. DTT and 5-FU promoted the expression of BDNF, while Salinomycin, Cisplatin and Ebselen treatment reduced its expression.

We report a rare case of a preterm infant who developed severe liver cirrhosis in the first few months of life, requiring liver transplant at three months of age. She presented with persistent hypoalbuminaemia, peripheral oedema, ascites, metabolic bone disease with fractures, coagulopathies, and anaemia. She subsequently developed multiorgan failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Extensive investigation found FOCAD gene defect, compound heterozygous for c.4435del p.Lys1475Asnfs* and exon 6-7 deletion. In conclusion, we hope to contribute to the awareness and growing understanding of FOCAD deficiency in children. This case highlights the importance of early diagnosis and consideration of screening for FOCAD deficiency in cases where the cause for cirrhosis is unknown. More research will be needed to better elucidate the full spectrum of the condition, as well as to establish potential prognostic markers and therapeutic targets.","Raja, S.; Ayres Da Silva, L.; Urs, M.",2025,Cureus,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IRI-inflicted graft injury can be reduced by using hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion (HOPE) as a preservation strategy instead of static cold storage (SCS). The endothelial glycocalyx is highly sensitive to IRI and its degradation during graft preservation and reperfusion was previously associated with inferior postoperative outcome after LT. Here, we aimed to measure glycocalyx degradation during and after HOPE in order to evaluate its potential for viability-assessment during machine perfusion and outcome prediction in patients undergoing LT., Methods: Glycocalyx degradation was quantified via enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) for its main component syndecan-1 (Sdc-1) in serum of 40 patients undergoing LT after HOPE. In addition, Sdc-1 was evaluated at multiple time points during HOPE. Patients were followed up for 3.5 years to assess postoperative complications including morbidity, the development of early allograft dysfunction (EAD) and graft survival., Results: Liver grafts which later developed EAD showed significantly higher Sdc-1 concentrations after 60 min of HOPE compared to grafts exhibiting normal postoperative function (P=0.02).

Pancreas transplant volumes are limited because of poor utilization of ""extended criteria grafts."" Prolonged cold ischemia is a risk factor associated with poor allograft survival. We aimed to establish the feasibility of transplantation using grafts subjected to prolonged cold ischemia and determine whether these grafts could be optimized using normothermic ex vivo perfusion (NEVP) in a porcine model., Methods. The study population consisted of 35 to 40 kg male Yorkshire pigs in an allotransplantation model with a 3-d survival plan for recipients. Control grafts were subjected to cold storage (CS) in a University of Wisconsin solution for 21 to 24 h (n = 6), whereas the test group received an additional 3 h NEVP after CS of 21 h (n = 5)., Results. The 3-d survival was 60% in the NEVP arm versus 0% in the control arm (P = 0.008; log rank). Graft parenchyma was 60% to 70% preserved in the NEVP arm at necropsy on gross appearance. In addition, the islet function was well preserved, and both the pancreas (including the islets) and the duodenal morphology were maintained histologically. The intravenous glucose tolerance test on the day of euthanasia was in the normoglycemic range for 80% of cases in the NEVP arm., Conclusions. Optimization of pancreas grafts exposed to extended CS with NEVP seems promising at rescuing and reanimating these grafts for transplantation, resulting in significantly improved survival in a porcine pancreas transplant model., (C) 2024 The Authors.

This study aims to summarize the impact of ICI use on post-LT outcomes. METHODS: In this individual patient data meta-analysis, we searched databases to identify HCC cases treated with ICIs before LT, detailing allograft rejection, HCC recurrence, and overall survival. We performed Cox regression analysis to identify risk factors for allograft rejection. RESULTS: Among 91 eligible patients, with a median (IQR) follow-up of 690.0 (654.5) days, there were 24 (26.4%) allograft rejections, 9 (9.9%) HCC recurrences, and 9 (9.9%) deaths. Age (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] per 10 years 0.72, 95% CI 0.53-0.99, p = 0.044) and ICI washout time (aHR per 1 week 0.92, 95% CI 0.86-0.99, p = 0.022) were associated with allograft rejection. The median (IQR) washout period for patients with ≤20% probability of allograft rejection was 94 (196) days. Overall survival did not differ between cases with and without allograft rejection (log-rank test, p = 0.2). Individuals with HCC recurrence had fewer median (IQR) ICI cycles than those without recurrence (4.0 [1.8] vs. 8.0 [9.0]; p = 0.025). The proportion of patients within Milan post-ICI was lower for those with recurrence vs. without (16.7% vs. 65.3%, p = 0.032). CONCLUSION: Patients have acceptable post-LT outcomes after ICI therapy. Age and ICI washout length relate to the allograft rejection risk, and a 3-month washout may reduce it to that of patients without ICI exposure. Number of ICI cycles and tumor burden may affect recurrence risk. Large prospective studies are necessary to confirm these associations. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: This systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis of 91 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and immune checkpoint inhibitor use prior to liver transplantation suggest acceptable overall post-transplant outcomes. Older age and longer immune checkpoint inhibitor washout period have a significant inverse association with the risk of allograft rejection. A 3-month washout may reduce it to that of patients without immune checkpoint inhibitor exposure. Additionally, a higher number of immune checkpoint inhibitor cycles and tumor burden within Milan criteria at the completion of immunotherapy may predict a decreased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence, but this observation requires further validation in larger prospective studies.","Rezaee-Zavareh, M.

426,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trre.2024.100853,Return of the cold: How hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion is changing liver transplantation,"Hypothermic Oxygenated machine PErfusion (HOPE) has recently emerged as a preservation technique which can reduce ischemic injury and improve clinical outcomes following liver transplantation. First developed with the advent solid organ transplantation techniques, hypothermic machine perfusion largely fell out of favour following the development of preservation solutions which can satisfactorily preserve grafts using the cheap and simple method, static cold storage (SCS). However, with an increasing need to develop techniques to reduce graft injury and better utilise marginal and donation after circulatory death (DCD) grafts, HOPE has emerged as a relatively simple and safe technique to optimise clinical outcomes following liver transplantation. Perfusing the graft with cold, acellular, oxygenated perfusate either via the portal vein (PV) alone, or via both the PV and hepatic artery (HA), HOPE is generally commenced for a period of 1-2 h immediately prior to implantation. The technique has been validated by multiple randomised control trials, and pre-clinical evidence suggests HOPE primarily reduces graft injury by decreasing the accumulation of harmful mitochondrial intermediates, and subsequently, the severity of post-reperfusion injury. HOPE can also facilitate real time graft assessment, most notably via the measurement of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) in the perfusate, allowing transplant teams to make better informed clinical decisions prior to transplantation. HOPE may also provide a platform to administer novel therapeutic agents to ex situ organs without risk of systemic side effects. As such, HOPE is uniquely positioned to revolutionise how liver transplantation is approached and facilitate optimised clinical outcomes for liver transplant recipients.

However, red blood cell hemolysis is a frequently underestimated complication that may impair the interpretation of viability metrics. This study aims to determine the impact of rising free hemoglobin levels (fHb) on hepatic perfusion during NMP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen healthy female porcine livers were perfused for 18 hours using a NMP circuit primed with autologous whole blood. Hourly measurements included fHb levels, total hepatic, portal, and arterial flows, as well as biochemical parameters. Correlations between fHb and perfusion parameters were evaluated using Spearman's rank test. RESULTS: All livers were successfully perfused for 18 h. Free hemoglobin levels progressively increased over time. Significant inverse correlations were observed between fHb and portal vein flow (ρ = -0.772) and total hepatic flow (ρ = -0.650). Among biochemical markers, only GGT and CK showed positive correlations with fHb. CONCLUSION: Progressive hemolysis during NMP is associated with impaired hepatic perfusion, affecting the portal system, and correlates with selective biochemical injury markers. These findings highlight the need for systematic monitoring of fHb in NMP protocols to ensure viability assessment and optimize graft preservation.","Rivera, A.; Fernandez-Lopez, I.; Del Canizo, J.

This study aims to evaluate the association between the implementation of NMP on liver transplant waitlist times at a single center. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent liver transplant at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center from 2014 to 2024. Waitlist times were compared between pre-NMP and post-NMP implementation periods. Matched cohorts based on sex, age, and the model for end-stage liver disease score were used to compare patients who received machine-perfused livers (NMP group) and those who did not (non-NMP group). Waitlist duration, donor type, hospital stay, overall survival, and graft failure were measured. A subgroup of patients diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was analyzed. RESULTS: Of 429 patients, median waitlist times were significantly reduced from 309 d pre-NMP to 48 d post-NMP (P < 0.001). In the matched analysis, the NMP group had a median waitlist time of 71 d, compared to 345 d for non-NMP group (P < 0.001). The NMP group had a 2-d shorter hospital stay than the non-NMP group (P < 0.001). For HCC patients, waitlist times decreased from 472 d pre-NMP to 83 d post-NMP (P < 0.001), and in the matched HCC cohorts, waitlist times decreased from 492 d to 121 d in the non-NMP and NMP groups, respectively (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: NMP implementation was associated with significantly shorter liver transplant waitlist times and reduced hospital stays, without compromising short-term survival outcomes. NMP may address the liver transplant shortage and improve access for patients, particularly those with HCC.","Rivera, B.; Cojuc-Konigsberg, G.; Canizares, S.; Chumdermpadetsuk, R.

We refined an original IGL2 solution, referred to as IGL2-M solution, which was compared to Histidine-Tryptophan-Ketoglutarate preservation solution used as a control. The IGL2-M solution demonstrated superior efficacy in preventing hepatocellular and mitochondrial damage in vulnerable steatotic grafts against ischemia-reperfusion injury. The IGL2-M solution better preserved the quality of fatty liver grafts compared to the Histidine-Tryptophan-Ketoglutarate solution, as evidenced by fewer danger signals after 24 hours of cold static preservation. Further investigations are warranted to explore these findings in greater depth.","Rosello, A. P.; Chullo, G.; Pera, M.; Bataller, R.; Fundora-Suárez, Y.; Adam, R.; Carbonell, T.; Catafau, J.

Traditionally, organs from cDCDD donors have been subject to standard rapid recovery (SRR) with poor posttransplant outcomes of abdominal organs, particularly the liver, and limited organ utilization. Normothermic regional perfusion (NRP), based on the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation devices, consists of the in situ perfusion of organs that will be subject to transplantation with oxygenated blood under normothermic conditions after the declaration of death and before organ recovery. NRP is a potential solution to address the limitations of traditional recovery methods. It has become normal practice in several European countries and has been recently introduced in the United States. The increased use of NRP in cDCDD has occurred as a result of a growing body of evidence on its association with improved posttransplant outcomes and organ utilization compared with SRR. However, the expansion of NRP is precluded by obstacles of an organizational, legal, and ethical nature. This article details the technique of both abdominal and thoracoabdominal NRP. Based on the available evidence, it describes its benefits in terms of posttransplant outcomes of abdominal and thoracic organs and organ utilization. It addresses cost-effectiveness aspects of NRP, as well as logistical and ethical obstacles that limit the implementation of this innovative preservation strategy.","Royo-Villanova, M.; Miñambres, E.; Coll, E.; Domínguez-Gil, B.",2025,Transplantation,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The perfused livers demonstrated positive viability indicators and disease-specific targeted metabolomics providing the proof-of-principle that our ex vivo model expresses the biochemical disease characteristics and responds to therapeutical intervention in a unique ""physiological"" milieu, offering an ideal tool to study novel treatments, in a setting closely mirroring human disease.","Safarikia, S.; Cirelli, R.; Spagnoletti, G.; Martinelli, D.; Bravetti, G.; Francalanci, P.; D'Alessandro, A.; Di Felice, G.; Maistri, M.; Baldissone, E.; Fratti, A.

64,40002907.0,10.3390/biomedicines13020494,Perspectives and Tools in Liver Graft Assessment: A Transformative Era in Liver Transplantation,"Liver transplantation is a critical and evolving field in modern medicine, offering life-saving treatment for patients with end-stage liver disease and other hepatic conditions. Despite its transformative potential, transplantation faces persistent challenges, including a global organ shortage, increasing liver disease prevalence, and significant waitlist mortality rates. Current donor evaluation practices often discard potentially viable livers, underscoring the need for refined graft assessment tools. This review explores advancements in graft evaluation and utilization aimed at expanding the donor pool and optimizing outcomes. Emerging technologies, such as imaging techniques, dynamic functional tests, and biomarkers, are increasingly critical for donor assessment, especially for marginal grafts. Machine learning and artificial intelligence, exemplified by tools like LiverColor, promise to revolutionize donor-recipient matching and liver viability predictions, while bioengineered liver grafts offer a future solution to the organ shortage. Advances in perfusion techniques are improving graft preservation and function, particularly for donation after circulatory death (DCD) grafts. While challenges remain-such as graft rejection, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and recurrence of liver disease-technological and procedural advancements are driving significant improvements in graft allocation, preservation, and post-transplant outcomes. This review highlights the transformative potential of integrating modern technologies and multidisciplinary approaches to expand the donor pool and improve equity and survival rates in liver transplantation.","Safi, K.; Pawlicka, A.

180,41017058.0,10.1111/petr.70186,Graft Characteristics to Optimize Outcomes in Pediatric Liver Transplantation,"BACKGROUND: Various efforts have been made to optimize the outcomes of pediatric liver transplantation (LT), which has become an established treatment for end-stage liver disease in children. Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) and split deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT) could increase the donor pool for children to dramatically reduce pretransplant waitlist mortality. METHODS: Graft characteristics to optimize the outcomes in pediatric LT have been analyzed from various aspects, including graft size matching, donor/graft quality, and graft procurement procedure. This special article reviews the current literature and delineates the principles/measures to make an appropriate graft selection and the graft procurement to obtain good-quality grafts. RESULTS: Several studies related to graft size matching in LDLT have elucidated the pathogenesis of ""small-for-size"" and ""large-for-size"" issues. The procedures used to make reduced left lateral segment grafts have been technically refined, and these grafts are widely applicable for small children. The livers from ABO-incompatible donors, hepatitis B core antibody-positive donors, and parental donors with a background of congenital inherited genetic disorders have been successfully transplanted into children by overcoming each barrier, and these livers are widely used in LDLT. Machine perfusion is a promising modality to optimize the extended criteria donor organs with outcomes comparable to those of good-quality grafts. CONCLUSION: A multidisciplinary approach, leveraging each advantage between DDLT and LDLT, is going to achieve the best outcomes in the field of pediatric LT. In addition, minimally invasive donor hepatectomy must be promoted to guarantee donor safety without compromising graft quality.","Sakamoto, S.; Kasahara, M.",2025,Pediatr Transplant,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ex vivo lung perfusion expands the lung transplant donor pool and extends preservation time beyond cold static preservation. We hypothesized that repeated regular ex vivo lung perfusion would better maintain lung grafts., Methods. Ten pig lungs were randomized into 2 groups. The control underwent 16 h of cold ischemic time and 2 h of cellular ex vivo lung perfusion. The intermittent ex vivo lung perfusion group underwent cold ischemic time for 4 h, ex vivo lung perfusion (first) for 2 h, cold ischemic time for 10 h, and 2 h of ex vivo lung perfusion (second). Lungs were assessed, and transplant suitability was determined after 2 h of ex vivo lung perfusion., Results. The second ex vivo lung perfusion was significantly associated with better oxygenation, limited extravascular water, higher adenosine triphosphate, reduced intraalveolar edema, and well-preserved mitochondria compared with the control, despite proinflammatory cytokine elevation. No significant difference was observed in the first and second perfusion regarding oxygenation and adenosine triphosphate, whereas the second was associated with lower dynamic compliance and higher extravascular lung water than the first. Transplant suitability was 100% for the first and 60% for the second ex vivo lung perfusion, and 0% for the control., Conclusions. The second ex vivo lung perfusion had a slight deterioration in graft function compared to the first. Intermittent ex vivo lung perfusion created a better condition for lung grafts than cold static preservation, despite cytokine elevation. These results suggested that intermittent ex vivo lung perfusion may help prolong lung preservation., Copyright (C) 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Non-invasive, whole-body anti-CD4 immunoPET can provide dynamic and spatial information (localization, proliferation, and migration) on CD4(+) T cells. The cys-diabody format enables site-specific radiolabeling and rapid renal clearance, which results in high-contrast images at early time points. PROCEDURES: In this work, an anti-CD4 cys-diabody based on the hybridoma GK1.5 was reengineered by CDR-grafting (GK1.5 FR cDb) for higher expression in mammalian cell lines. An N-glycosylation motif in the variable light chain domain framework was removed by site-directed mutagenesis, resulting in GK1.5 N80D cDb. To investigate the impact of the variable domain glycan on the in vivo biodistribution and pharmacokinetics, both cys-diabodies were site-specifically conjugated with deferoxamine-maleimide and radiolabeled by chelation of zirconium-89. Serial immunoPET/CT imaging was used for non-invasive, whole-body assessment of specific targeting, biodistribution, and differential clearance of the two novel anti-CD4 cys-diabodies. RESULTS: The anti-CD4 cys diabody was successfully re-engineered by CDR-grafting (GK1.5 FR cDb) and aglycosylation (GK1.5 N80D cDb), resulting in a higher expression yield (~ tenfold increase) without impacting antigen specificity or affinity. Both cys-diabody variants were successfully (89)Zr-radiolabeled with similar specific activity and radiochemical purity. ImmunoPET imaging of (89)Zr-GK1.5 FR cDb and (89)Zr-GK1.5 N80D cDb in immunocompetent mice showed CD4 antigen-specific lymphoid tissue uptake in vivo. (89)Zr-GK1.5 FR cDb exhibited rapid hepatic clearance, resulting in significantly reduced uptake in lymph nodes and the spleen. Removal of the N-glycosylation motif in (89)Zr-GK1.5 N80D cDb restored diabody-typical biodistribution (renal clearance), resulting in higher target tissue uptake. CONCLUSION: The novel reengineered anti-CD4 GK1.5 N80D cDb overcomes the previous production yield bottleneck and provides same-day (89)Zr-immunoPET imaging for non-invasive, whole-body visualization of murine CD4(+) T cells.","Salazar, F.

117,40388243.0,10.1111/ctr.70170,Establishing a Normothermic Machine Perfusion Program for Liver Transplantation: Lessons Learned and Early Outcomes in the United States,"BACKGROUND: Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) has emerged as a promising technology in liver transplantation, but limited data exist regarding real-world implementation in the United States following FDA approval. We report our experience establishing an NMP program and share insights from our first 100 cases. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 100 consecutive liver NMP cases performed between July 2023 and May 2024 using the OrganOx Metra device. Program establishment required assembling a dedicated team, comprehensive training, establishing a dedicated perfusion facility, coordinating with multiple departments including laboratory, blood bank, electronic medical record vendors, and billing services, and developing institutional viability criteria. RESULTS: Of 100 NMP cases, 92 proceeded to transplantation while eight were declined. Early allograft dysfunction occurred in 19 cases (20.7%) with no instances of primary non-function, and 90-day graft survival was 94.6%. No graft losses were directly attributable to NMP. Six grafts showed delayed lactate clearance but achieved successful outcomes with extended perfusion time. We systematically refined our protocols and developed standardized troubleshooting approaches to address various technical challenges including graft bleeding, arterial flow monitoring issues, persistent acidosis, and bile duct drainage issues. CONCLUSIONS: Successful implementation of an NMP program requires careful preparation, dedicated staffing, and interdepartmental coordination. Although various challenges are expected in the initial phase of the program, these can be successfully managed with a systematic approach. Our experience provides practical guidance for centers planning to establish NMP programs.","Sambommatsu, Y.; Imai, D.; Savsani, K.; Datta, M.; Tarashi, J.; Hallesy, J.; Wolfe, S.; Khan, A.

These organs have higher risks for complications; however, hypothermic-oxygenated perfusion (HOPE) was found to improve outcomes, including graft survival. We aim to assess the effect of HOPE on different types of ECD liver grafts. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted of PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases to identify studies that compared HOPE versus static cold storage (SCS) for ECD. Subgroup analysis on ECD from brain death (DBD-ECD) and circulatory death (DCD) donors, and of randomized controlled trials (RCT) were conducted. Primary endpoints were primary non-function (PNF), early allograft dysfunction (EAD), length of ICU/hospital stay, vascular/biliary complications, retransplantation, and graft survival. RESULTS: Twelve studies were identified comprising 1833 transplant patients (29% receiving HOPE and 71% SCS). Pooled analysis showed a significant reduction of EAD, 1-year graft failure rate, retransplantation rate, non-anastomotic biliary strictures and Clavien-Dindo Grade ≥ 3 complications favoring HOPE. Subgroup analysis on DBD-ECD grafts yielded lower EAD and shorter length of the hospital stay with HOPE. Further subgroup analysis on DCD grafts demonstrated lower EAD rates, superior 1-year graft survival rates, and reduced NAS in the HOPE group. Finally, analysis including RCTs revealed decreased EAD and retransplantation rates in the HOPE group. CONCLUSIONS: Reported outcomes after ECD liver transplantation were significantly improved with HOPE compared to SCS alone. This effect was even more pronounced in DCD grafts.","Sanha, V.; Trindade, B. O.; Satish, S.; Oliveira, L. B.; Karakaya, O. F.; Jiao, C.; Sun, K.; Nadeem, M. A.; Miller, C.; Hashimoto, K.; Wehrle, C.

Clinically, the worst outcomes are mainly related to severe ischemia-reperfusion-injury and the dangerous effect of various inflammatory cytokines (CK). The machine perfusion (MP) is a promising device to rescue these grafts. AIM: To analyze the role of MP connected to a sorbent cartridge (PerSorb(®)) and used for very damaged DCD pig livers. METHODS: Seven grafts were procured from pigs from a slaughterhouse. Grafts were made very marginal with at least 60 minutes of donor warm ischemia time and 24 hours of static-cold ischemia time: (1) 3 grafts were perfused in hypothermic MP with PerSorb (Sorb); (2) 2 other grafts in hypothermic MP (HMP) without the cartridge (NoSorb); and (3) The other 2 livers stored in the ice box (NoTreat). The CK were measured at HMP start (T0) and at the end (Tend). Biopsies were taken at T0 and Tend. RESULTS: All 5 grafts treated with HMP had a negative lactate trend after 3 hours of treatment (8.83 at T0 vs 6.4 at Tend of Sorb; 15 at T0 vs 5.45 at Tend for NoSorb, P value > 0.05). At Tend, both Sorb and NoSorb groups had better hemodynamic parameters, comparable between the two groups. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis showed a reduction of monocyte chemotactic protein-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1β for NoSorb group at Tend and a complete downregulation to physiological levels of the same CK in Sorb livers after 3 hours of treatment. Biopsies showed a reduction of the perisinusoidal edema for the Sorb grafts compared with the NoSorb livers. CONCLUSION: These data suggest a potential protective role of treatment of grafts with MP and sorbent cartridge in reducing the inflammatory response after a severe ischemic injury.","Scalera, I.; Franzin, R.; Stasi, A.; Castellaneta, A.; Fischetti, E.; Morelli, G.; Raele, M.; Panetta, E.; Kurevija, A.; Pulga, W.; Atti, M.; Gesualdo, L.",2025,World J Transplant,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They improve logistics, simplify recipient matching, and aid in transplant decisions. At the same time, researchers globally are actively working on technologies to extend organ preservation times, mainly for transplantation. This paper investigates what it takes to keep a liver viable ex vivo using machine perfusion, outlining the essential conditions and key viability criteria during perfusion. The project's aim was to create a long-term liver perfusion machine that mimics the body's core functions, offering an artificial environment as close as possible to natural in vivo physiological conditions. After a successful 5-year development phase with porcine livers, the technology was then tested on two prototypes using human livers that were unsuitable for transplantation. This paper shares the experience, discoveries, and lessons learned during the research and development of a long-term liver perfusion machine. It considers both the current state of the art and existing clinical practices in transplantation. The viability criteria are also discussed from the perspective of long-term perfusion, especially since there's no current consensus in this area. Furthermore, the potential applications of these technologies are described. Overall, this long-term perfusion technology is seen as a platform that could unlock exciting new clinical applications, offering significant patient benefits that may outweigh the economic challenges. Nevertheless, considerable research is still needed to bring these concepts and ideas into routine clinical practice.","Schuler, M.

Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) enables pretransplantation assessment of donor liver viability to increase donor liver utilization. However, unambiguous objective criteria to determine integrated liver function during NMP to decide upon acceptance are still lacking. This study investigates whether the indocyanine green (ICG) elimination test can be applied to assess liver function during NMP., Methods. Donor livers underwent dual-hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion and NMP. The ICG elimination test was improved during an optimization phase (n = 10) and tested against current functional perfusion parameters and posttransplantation outcomes in clinically perfused livers (n = 32)., Results. The ICG plasma disappearance rate (PDR) during NMP was dependent on perfusion blood flow and liver weight. The corrected PDR (NMP-PDR) was correlated to the hepatic extraction rate (R = 0.923; P > 0.001) and ATP content in liver biopsies at 2 h of NMP (R = 0.692; P = 0.027). In the clinical phase, the length of the functional warm ischemia time in the donation process was inversely correlated to the NMP-PDR (P = 0.042). Both individual acceptance criteria (lactate clearance, ability of self-regulate pH, [DELTA]bicarbonate, and [DELTA]pH) and overall hepatocellular and cholangiocellular acceptance criteria were correlated to the NMP-PDR. The NMP-PDR was higher in the cohort accepted for transplantation (n = 18; 18.1%/L[middle dot]kg [14.0% to 22.7%/L[middle dot]kg]) than in the nontransplanted cohort (n = 14; 11.8%/L[middle dot]kg [8.8% to 12.9%/L[middle dot]kg]; P < 0.0001). Furthermore, the NMP-PDR correlated with the liver graft assessment following transplantation at 7 d score posttransplantation (R = -0.551; P = 0.027)., Conclusions.

Although machine perfusion (MP) may mitigate these risks, its cost and logistical complexity limit widespread application. We developed the Dynamic Organ Storage System (DOSS), which delivers oxygenated perfusate at 10°C with minimal electrical power requirement and allows real-time effluent sampling in a portable cooler. In a porcine DCD model, livers were preserved using DOSS or SCS for 10 hours and evaluated with 4 hours of normothermic MP, with n = 5 per group. After 4 hours of normothermic MP, the DOSS group demonstrated significantly lower perfusate lactate ( p = 0.023), increased perfusate fibrinogen ( p = 0.005), higher oxygen consumption ( p = 0.018), greater bile production ( p = 0.013), higher bile bicarbonate levels ( p = 0.035) and bile/perfusate sodium ratio ( p = 0.002), and lower hepatic arterial resistance after phenylephrine administration ( p = 0.018). Histological analysis showed lower apoptotic markers in DOSS-preserved livers, with fewer cleaved caspase-3 ( p = 0.039) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL; p = 0.009) positive cells. These findings suggest that DOSS can enhance DCD allograft function during transport, offering potential clinical benefits and contributing to the expansion of the donor pool.","Shishido, Y.; Tracy, K.

This study aimed to explore the impact of MP on HCC recurrence. We included data from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database on HCC patients spanning from April 2015 and January 2024. Patients who received MP-preserved donor were propensity score-matched (PSM) 1:1 with those who received static cold storage (SCS)-preserved donor. The primary outcome was recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate. Cox regression models were used to identify predictors of RFS. Subgroup analyses assessed the role of MP across various groups and to identify the beneficial group. The PSM cohort comprised 411 HCC recipients with MP-preserved donors and 411 with SCS-preserved donors. The 2-year RFS rate was significantly higher in the MP group compared to the SCS group (96.5 % vs. 89.7 %, P = 0.008). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed that MP preservation method was an independent predictor of RFS [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR), 0.158; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 0.048-0.523; P = 0.003]. In the beneficial group, defined by the cumulative of MP-enhancing factors, MP improved RFS comparable to SCS group (96.7 % vs. 76.2 %, P = 0.001). MP effectively prevents HCC recurrence post-LT. MP should be used more proactively in the beneficial groups, including those with hemodynamically unstable donors and high tumor burden, to improve the survival outcomes.","Shu, W.; Chen, H.; Wang, R.; Song, J.; Tang, R.; Wu, G.; Yu, L.; Tong, X.; Wang, X.; Hou, Y.; Zhao, W.

Tumour-to-nontumour uptake varies among patients, possibly influenced by patient-specific blood flow profiles. To examine the impact of HA blood flow rate and high microsphere dosages on microsphere distribution in normal liver parenchyma, ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided machine perfusion experiments were conducted in porcine livers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Porcine livers were subjected to oxygenated normothermic machine perfusion at three HA flow rates (0.02, 0.15, and 0.22 mL/min/g liver tissue; n = 3 per condition). Five fractions of 250 mg nonradioactive (165)Ho-loaded microspheres were administered to n = 9 livers, and four additional fractions of 1,000 mg to n = 6 livers. Dynamic contrast-enhanced and Ho-sensitive T2*-weighed MR scans were acquired to extract perfusion rates, fictive dose maps, and homogeneity indices (HI). RESULTS: Microsphere distribution correlated moderately with perfusion rate at low HA flow rate (r = 0.611), and very strongly at higher HA flow rates (r = 0.977 and 0.951 for 0.15 and 0.22 mL/min/g, respectively). Homogeneity increased with increasing flow rates, with HIs ranging from 3.68-4.72 at low, to 2.01-2.66 at medium, and 1.60-2.36 at high HA flow rate. HI decreased with higher microsphere concentrations, though distribution patterns remained unchanged. CONCLUSION: In our ex vivo model, higher HA flow rates resulted in more homogeneous microsphere distributions. The impact on tumourous tissue needs further investigation to determine whether pre-TARE HA blood flow measurements could improve microsphere distribution predictions. RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Mapping of the hepatic arterial blood flow rate before transarterial radioembolisation and adjusting the treatment accordingly may help to improve outcomes for patients with liver cancer. KEY POINTS: Parameters influencing microsphere distribution were studied in MRI-perfused healthy porcine livers. Higher hepatic arterial blood flow rates led to more homogeneous microsphere distributions. Administering large numbers of microspheres did not alter microsphere distribution patterns.

69,39555750.0,10.1111/aor.14910,Circulating cell-free DNA in liver transplantation: A pre- and post-transplant biomarker of graft dysfunction,"BACKGROUND: Liver transplantation (LT) is still limited by organ shortage and post-transplant monitoring issues. While machine perfusion techniques allow for improving organ preservation, biomarkers like donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) and mitochondrial cfDNA (mt-cfDNA) may provide insights into graft injury and viability pre- and post-LT. METHODS: A prospective observational cohort study was conducted on LT recipients (n = 45) to evaluate dd-cfDNA as a biomarker of graft dysfunction during the first 6 months after LT. Dd-cfDNA was quantified on blood samples collected pre-LT and post-LT using droplet digital PCR. In livers undergoing dual hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion (D-HOPE), total cfDNA and mt-cfDNA levels were measured on perfusate samples collected at 30-min intervals. Correlations with graft function and clinical outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: Dd-cfDNA levels peaked post-LT and correlated with transaminase levels and histological injury severity. The longitudinal assessment showed that postoperative complications and rejection were associated with an increase in dd-cfDNA levels. Mt-cfDNA levels in D-HOPE perfusate correlated with graft function parameters post-LT and were higher in patients with early allograft dysfunction and severe complications. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms dd-cfDNA as a marker of graft injury after LT and suggests that perfusate mt-cfDNA levels during D-HOPE correlate with graft function and post-transplant clinical outcome. Integration of these tests into clinical practice may improve transplant management and viability assessment during hypothermic perfusion.","Sorbini, M.; Carradori, T.; Patrono, D.; Togliatto, G.; Caorsi, C.; Vaisitti, T.; Mansouri, M.; Delsedime, L.; Vissio, E.; De Stefano, N.; Papotti, M.; Amoroso, A.; Romagnoli, R.; Deaglio, S.",2025,Artif Organs,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NRP has revolutionized DCD liver transplant by extending donor criteria and reducing the incidence of ischemic cholangiopathy (IC) and other complications in recipients. However, there is significant geographic and center-specific variation in NRP use and practices. This review collates practices from pioneering NRP centers across the globe regarding donor selection criteria, NRP techniques, organ viability monitoring, and other key areas to help guide the continued growth of NRP liver transplantation. RECENT FINDINGS: DCD livers recovered using NRP have consistently demonstrated excellent outcomes, with IC and patient and graft survival rates approaching those seen with grafts from donation after brain death donors. Recently, transplant centers have been working to increase the DCD donor pool by relaxing limits on donor quality, reconsidering organ viability markers, and combining NRP with ex situ machine perfusion technologies. SUMMARY: NRP is a powerful organ recovery technology transforming the practice of DCD liver transplantation. Current evidence suggests that organ utilization could be further expanded using NRP recovery, with excellent clinical outcomes reported by centers using less stringent donor and organ viability criteria.","Stahl, C.

A key mechanism underlying lipotoxicity is endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, particularly the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). This study investigates the interplay between lipid accumulation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and cellular outcomes, focusing on the balance between autophagy and apoptosis. We cultured primary human hepatocytes (PHH) in a free fatty acid (FFA)-enriched medium for 120 h, assessing lipid accumulation, metabolism, and the expression of selected UPR markers. Additionally, we investigated the effects of lipid load on cell activity and growth in proliferating HepG2 cells. We observed that FFA uptake consistently induced ER stress, shifting cellular responses toward apoptosis under high lipid loads. Donor-specific differences were evident, particularly in lipid storage, excretion, and sensitivity to lipotoxicity. Some donors exhibited limited triglyceride (TAG) storage and excretion, leading to an excess of FFA whose metabolic fate remains unclear. Proliferation was more sensitive to lipid accumulation than overall cell activity, with even low FFA concentrations impairing growth, highlighting the vulnerability of regenerative processes to steatosis. The study elucidates how ER stress pathways, such as PERK-CHOP and IRE1α-JNK, are differentially activated in response to lipid overload, tipping the balance toward apoptosis in severe cases. The limited activation of repair mechanisms, such as autophagy, further emphasizes the critical role of ER stress in determining hepatocyte fate. The donor-dependent variability highlights the need for personalized strategies to mitigate lipotoxic effects and enhance liver regeneration in steatosis-related conditions.","Stilkerich, A.; Schicht, G.; Seidemann, L.; Hänsel, R.; Friebel, A.; Hoehme, S.; Seehofer, D.; Damm, G.",2025,Cells,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we investigated the use of normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) to advance xenotransplantation research and develop bridging therapies for acute organ failure such as the use of pig livers as a liver dialysis system. We simultaneously analyzed livers and lungs from genetically modified pigs, carrying a knock-out of the GGTA1 gene, which is essential for xenoreactive αGal-KO-epitopes, by applying clinically established normothermic perfusion systems, solutions and human blood. Experiments involved perfusing organs with cell-free solutions as well as human erythrocyte concentrates for up to six hours, analyzing organ quality using invasive and non-invasive methods, and the isolation and analysis of immune cells from the perfusate. The results obtained show stable flow characteristics with physiological perfusion and oxygenation levels of the organs, and a largely intact organ architecture, confirmed by histological sections before and after perfusion.

Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) of liver allografts has emerged to increase the number of transplantable organs and may have utility during donation after circulatory death (DCD) liver transplantation in reducing transfusion burden and vasoactive medication requirements. METHODS: This is a single-center retrospective study involving 226 DCD liver transplant recipients who received an allograft transported with NMP (DCD-NMP group) or with static cold storage (DCD-SCS group). Veno-venous bypass was not used in any patients. Infusion doses of norepinephrine, epinephrine, and vasopressin as well as bolus doses of vasoactive medications during reperfusion were recorded. Blood component therapy was recorded according to phase of liver transplantation and during the first 24 hours postprocedure. RESULTS: A total of 103 recipients in the DCD-NMP group and 123 patients in the DCD-SCS group were included. Post-reperfusion syndrome (PRS) incidence was reduced in the DCD-NMP group compared to the DCD-SCS group (10.7% [95% confidence interval, CI, 5.5%-18.3%] vs 42.3% [95% CI, 33.4%-51.5%]; P < .001). During the reperfusion period, patients in the DCD-SCS group required increased bolus doses of epinephrine and vasopressin compared to the DCD-NMP group (24.6 vs 7.5 µg; P < .001) and (5.4 vs 2.4 units; P < .001), respectively. The DCD-SCS group received a higher infusion dose of epinephrine during anhepatic phase, at reperfusion, and up to 90 minutes after reperfusion. In the postreperfusion period, there were significant increases in the transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs; 5.3 vs 3.7 units; P = .006), fresh frozen plasma (FFP; 3.4 vs 1.9 units; P < .001), cryoprecipitate (2.7 vs 1.8 pooled units; P = .015) and platelets (0.9 vs 0.4 units; P = .008) in the DCD-SCS group compared to the DCD-NMP group. During the first 24 hours postprocedure, transfusion of RBCs, FFP, and cryoprecipitate in the DCD-SCS group was increased compared to the DCD-NMP group ([2.6 vs 1.7 units; P = .028], [1.6 vs 0.8 units; P < .001], [1.5 vs 0.9 pooled units; P = .031]) respectively. Administration of tranexamic acid was more frequent in the DCD-SCS group during the post-reperfusion period compared to the DCD-NMP group (13% [95% CI, 5.7%-17.4%] vs 3.9% [95% CI, 1.1%-9.6% 95%]; P = .018). CONCLUSIONS: In DCD liver transplantation, use of NMP was associated with reduced incidence of PRS and decreased vasopressor and inotrope requirements at the time of allograft reperfusion compared to using SCS. Additionally, NMP was associated with reduced transfusion of all blood product components as well as antifibrinolytic agent administration in the post-reperfusion period. Reduced transfusion burden in the DCD-NMP group also occurred during the first 24 hours posttransplant.","Stoker, A. D.; Gorlin, A. W.; Rosenfeld, D. M.; Nguyen, M. C.; Mathur, A.

Extending this time could electivise transplantation and enable physiologic assessments of functionality. Porcine kidneys were retrieved, stored on ice for 3.5 hours before being placed onto a NMP circuit for 12 hours. Hemodynamics, biochemistry, and urine output were assessed. After 12 hours, kidneys were scored using the clinical assessment score. Biopsies were collected for histological assessment. Kidneys demonstrated continual improvements in hemodynamics. Perfusate sodium concentrations remained within physiologic parameters. Sodium bicarbonate increased over-time with corresponding decreases in lactate, demonstrating active renal gluconeogenesis and Cori cycle processes. Urine production began immediately and was sustained, indicating renal functionality. Under the clinical perfusion assessment score, all kidneys received a score of 1 and would be considered suitable for transplantation. Histological assessment revealed kidneys were injury free. Our NMP protocol safely preserves kidneys for over 15 hours. Successful perfusion was achieved with stable hemodynamics and biochemistry, with maintained urination.

These require improved preservation techniques and reliable methods to assess graft function. This study aimed to evaluate changes in the kidney metabolome following three preservation methods: normothermic ex vivo kidney perfusion (NEVKP), hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) and static cold storage (SCS) in porcine autotransplant models. A chemical biopsy allowed minimally invasive sampling of metabolites, which were analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry. The results highlighted metabolites affected by ischemia and oxidative stress in donor kidneys, as well as changes specific to each preservation method. Differences were observed immediately after transplantation and reperfusion and several days post-surgery. NEVKP was associated with the activation of physiological anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory mechanisms, suggesting potential protective effects. However, some metabolites had dual roles, which may influence future graft treatment designs. HMP and SCS, while reducing energy demand in cells, also limit physiological repair mechanisms. These findings provide a basis for improving graft assessment and organ preservation, with chemical biopsy serving as both a tool for discovery and a potential diagnostic method for monitoring graft quality.","Stryjak, Iga; Warmuzinska, Natalia; Luczykowski, Kamil; Wnuk, Kacper; Rosales-Solano, Hernando; Janiszek, Patrycja; Urbanellis, Peter; Buszko, Katarzyna; Pawliszyn, Janusz; Selzner, Markus; Bojko, Barbara",2025,International journal of molecular sciences,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Excessive lipid accumulation triggers endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and autophagy flux dysfunction, which are important mechanisms for NAFLD. Trehalose (Tre), a natural disaccharide, has been identified to reduce hepatic steatosis and glucose intolerance. However, its underlying mechanisms for NAFLD remain unclear. In this study, a high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced mouse NAFLD model and a saturated fatty acid palmitic acid (PA)-stimulated cell model were constructed. The results indicated that Tre supplementation ameliorated hepatocyte lipid deposition in vitro, as well as hepatic steatosis and hyperlipidemia in vivo. Mechanistically, Tre alleviated both autophagy flux dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Under the stimulation of HFD or PA, Tre remarkably increased the expression and nucleic translocation of the lysosomal master protein transcription factor EB (TFEB), while decreasing the accumulation of p62 and also decreasing the ER stress markers (inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1α), XBP-1, CHOP, and BIP). Similar results were observed in an ER stressor tunicamycin (TM)-induced in vivo and in vitro models. In addition, the transcriptomic analysis of NAFLD patients revealed significant differences in ER stress-related and autophagy-related biomarkers, including TFEB, ATG7, IRE1α, and CHOP. Molecular docking results demonstrated a strong affinity between Tre and both IRE1α and TFEB. Overall, Tre protected hepatocytes from lipotoxicity-related ER stress and autophagy dysfunction, and its regulatory effect on the IRE1α-TFEB signaling pathway may be a critical mechanism. These findings suggest that Tre, as a bioactive substance with significant medicinal potential, holds considerable promise for drug development and clinical application in treating NAFLD.","Su, S.; Liu, X.; Zhu, M.; Liu, W.; Liu, J.; Yuan, Y.; Fu, F.; Rao, Z.; Liu, J.; Lu, Y.; Chen, Y.",2025,J Agric Food Chem,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, existing viability parameters are based on routine clinical assessment in patients with acute liver failure, trauma, or liver resections. These parameters often do not correlate with clinically relevant post-transplant outcomes. METHODS: This article presents a detailed protocol for the spectrophotometric quantification of Flavin mononucleotide (FMN), a marker of mitochondrial injury. FMN release from mitochondrial complex I was described many decades ago as the initial sign of ischaemia-reperfusion injury, i.e. when oxygen is reintroduced in ischaemic tissues during organ transplantation or machine perfusion. This study describes the detailed FMN quantification in donor plasma and various fluids obtained during machine perfusion, and discusses confounders, challenges, and the role of individual test components. FINDINGS: FMN quantification was identified as an immediate organ assessment tool, demonstrating a strong correlation with graft survival and other relevant complications after human liver transplantation. INTERPRETATION: The results highlight FMN quantification as a reliable and standardized method for assessing organ viability, offering significant potential for improving organ selection and better utilisation.

Hydrogen Sulfide (H(2)S) is an endogenously produced gas, previously demonstrated to reduce oxidative stress, reduce ATP depletion, and protect from ischemia and reperfusion injury. H(2)S is difficult to administer due to its rapid release curve, resulting in cellular death at high concentrations. AP39, a mitochondrially targeted, slow-release H(2)S donor, has been shown to reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury in hearts and kidneys. Thus, we investigated whether the addition of AP39 during 3-day static cold storage can improve liver graft viability. At the end of storage, livers underwent six hours of acellular normothermic machine perfusion, a model of transplantation. During simulated transplantation, livers stored with AP39 showed reduced resistance, reduced cellular damage (ALT and AST), and reduced apoptosis. Additionally, bile production and glucose, as well as energy charge were improved by the addition of AP39.

Our team developed a transportable dual hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion (DHOPE) device, which initiates DHOPE at a recipient center to reduce static cold storage (SCS) time and the risk of graft failure in DCD liver transplantation. METHODS: Six porcine livers per group with 30 min of warm ischemia exposure were preserved via SCS or DHOPE for 6 h and then reperfused for 12 h with whole blood to mimic transplantation. Hepatocellular and biliary function and injury were assessed in perfusate and bile samples. Molecular biomarkers and histology were compared between groups. RESULTS: Reperfusion portal vein pressure, in a flow-constant manner, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (γ-GGT) release were significantly lower in the DHOPE group than in the SCS group at all time points. Higher bile production paralleled the lower levels of ALP and γ-GGT in the DHOPE group. The DHOPE group secreted more total bilirubin (TBIL) in bile, resulting in decreased TBIL in the perfusate, and livers preserved with DHOPE exhibited better cholangiocellular function. Furthermore, improvements in hypoxia, the inflammatory response, cell-free microRNAs and energy metabolism were observed in the DHOPE group. There were fewer apoptotic cells and TGF-β1-positive cells in the liver parenchyma and extrahepatic bile duct in the DHOPE group than in the SCS group.

This meta-analysis evaluated the potential benefits of HOPE in liver transplantation., Materials and methods: The Embase, Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases were searched for articles published up to 15 June 2023 (updated on 12 August 2023). Mean differences (MDs), risk ratios (RRs), and 95% confidence intervals were calculated., Results: Eleven studies encompassing five randomized controlled trials and six matched studies were included, with a total of 1000 patients. HOPE did not reduce the incidence of major postoperative complications (RR 0.80), primary non-function (PNF) (RR 0.54), reperfusion syndrome (RR 0.92), hepatic artery thrombosis (RR 0.92), renal replacement therapy (RR 0.98), length of hospital stay (MD, -1.38 days), 1-year recipient death (RR 0.67), or intensive care unit stay (MD, 0.19 days) after liver transplantation. HOPE reduced the incidence of biliary complications (RR 0.74), non-anastomotic biliary strictures (NAS) (RR 0.34), early allograft dysfunction (EAD) (RR 0.54), and acute rejection (RR 0.54). In addition, HOPE improved the retransplantation (RR 0.42) and 1-year graft loss rates (RR 0.38)., Conclusions: Compared with static cold storage (SCS), HOPE can reduce the incidence of biliary complications, NAS, EAD, and acute rejection and retransplantation rate after liver transplantation and improve the 1-year graft loss rate. These findings suggest that HOPE, when compared to SCS, can contribute to minimizing complications and enhancing graft survival in liver transplantation. Further research is needed to investigate long-term outcomes and confirm the promising advantages of HOPE in liver transplantation settings., (C) 2024 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.","Tang, G.; Zhang, L.; Xia, L.; Zhang, J.; Wei, Z.; Zhou, R.",2024,Int J Surg,EMBASE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
405,,10.1097/TXD.0000000000001597,Development of a Large Animal Model of Ischemia-free Liver Transplantation in Pigs,"Background. In organ transplantation, ischemia, and reperfusion injury (IRI) is considered as an inevitable event and the major contributor to graft failure. Ischemia-free liver transplantation (IFLT) is a novel transplant procedure that can prevent IRI and provide better transplant outcomes. However, a large animal model of IFLT has not been reported. Therefore, we develop a new, reproducible, and stable model of IFLT in pigs for investigating mechanisms of IFLT in IRI., Methods. Ten pigs were subjected to IFLT or conventional liver transplantation (CLT). Donor livers in IFLT underwent 6-h continuous normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) throughout graft procurement, preservation, and implantation, whereas livers in CLT were subjected to 6-h cold storage before implantation. The early reperfusion injury was compared between the 2 groups., Results. Continuous bile production, low lactate, and liver enzyme levels were observed during NMP in IFLT. All animals survived after liver transplantation. The posttransplant graft function was improved with IFLT when compared with CLT. Minimal histologic changes, fewer apoptotic hepatocytes, less sinusoidal endothelial cell injury, and proinflammatory cytokine (interleukin [IL]-1[beta], IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-[alpha]) release after graft revascularization were documented in the IFLT group versus the CLT group., Conclusions. We report that the concept of IFLT is achievable in pigs. This innovation provides a potential strategy to investigate the mechanisms of IRI and provide better transplant outcomes for clinical practice., (C) 2024 The Authors.

169,40418973.0,10.1055/a-2601-9426,Emerging Targets for the Treatment of Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis,"Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare, progressive cholestatic disease of unknown etiology and characterized by inflammation and stricturing of intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic bile ducts. This process leads to bile duct scarring, progressive liver fibrosis, and end-stage liver disease. PSC is often associated with a specific form of inflammatory bowel disease and patients face a significant risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma and colorectal cancer. The clinical course of PSC can differ significantly between subtypes and affected individuals, representing a major obstacle to successful medical treatment trials. Numerous innovative therapeutic targets have been identified and, at least in part, explored, including nuclear and membrane receptors regulating bile acid metabolism and transport, modulation of gut microbiota, and signaling molecules involved in liver inflammation and fibrosis. Successful drug testing in preclinical PSC models as well as positive signals from some clinical studies justify hope. However, no medical treatment has so far been proven to improve transplant-free survival or overall survival in PSC patients. Disease-modifying drugs are urgently awaited. Despite ongoing efforts to improve study designs and implement treatment trials for novel drug targets, a central breakthrough has not yet been convincingly achieved. This situation might change in the near future. This article summarizes current research efforts aimed at developing medical treatments for PSC.","Tatscher, E.; Mady, S.; Fickert, P.",2025,Semin Liver Dis,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The past decade has seen significant strides in donor pool expansion with acceptable clinical outcomes, while improved patient selection and advances in the management of chronic liver disease and post-LT complications have promoted better allograft health. This document aims to provide an evidence-based guideline on the management of graft complications, immunosuppression, graft rejection and recurrent disease in adult LT recipients. METHODS: A multidisciplinary writing group of experts (transplant hepatologists, surgeons, pathologist, and psychiatrist) was tasked to formulate clinical questions (in PICO format) that arise during routine management of adult LT recipients. The writing group reviewed the literature, generated guideline recommendations and rated the level of evidence for each recommendation based on the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine. The group categorized the strength of recommendations based on the level of evidence, risk-benefit ratio, and patient preferences. CONCLUSION: While robust clinical trial data provide strong guidance on some aspects of graft management in LT such as machine perfusion and immunosuppression efficacy and safety, a significant component of graft management is derived from retrospective cohort data, extrapolation of data from other solid organ transplants, or expert opinion, including the treatment of antibody-mediated rejection. Finally, further investigation is needed to truly optimize the management of the liver allograft, including the prevention of recurrent alcohol-associated, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic and immune-mediated liver diseases.","Te, H.

Donor shortages necessitate the use of higher risk donor livers, including fatty livers, which are more susceptible to ischemia-reperfusion injury. Machine perfusion has improved graft utilization and is typically performed at hypothermic (8-12°C) or normothermic (35-37°C) temperatures. Here we studied the impact of mild hyperthermia (40°C) as a therapeutic intervention for fatty livers using in-depth proteomic and lipoprotein profiling of whole organ perfusion and precision-cut liver slices. We observed proteomic changes with metabolic alterations over time, evidenced by a significant increase in lipid export in whole organ perfusions. Furthermore, PCLS showed significant upregulation of metabolic processes and heat shock protein response after 24 h of hyperthermia. Machine perfusion under hyperthermic conditions may be a potential strategy to improve the utilization of fatty liver grafts, ultimately expanding the donor pool and improving transplant outcomes.","Thorne, A.

Pegaspargase-associated hepatotoxicity is most common during induction, and its incidence increases with age and body mass index (BMI). We hypothesized that the delayed administration of pegaspargase during induction is associated with lower risk of hepatotoxicity while retaining efficacy. We retrospectively reviewed 141 adult patients with newly diagnosed ALL who received pegaspargase during induction from November 2013 to February 2024. There were 78 (55.3%) patients who received early pegaspargase (EP) on day 4 and 63 (44.7%) patients who received delayed pegaspargase (DP) on day 15. High-grade hepatotoxicity (grade ≥ 3 transaminitis and/or hyperbilirubinaemia) occurred more frequently in the EP group (p = 0.06). Rates of complete remission and negative minimal residual disease post induction were not different between cohorts. Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that BMI and age significantly predicted an increased risk of high-grade hepatotoxicity while DP was associated with a lower risk (odds ratio = 0.44; p = 0.04). Overall survival and event-free survival were not significantly different between cohorts. Delaying pegaspargase administration from day 4 to day 15 during induction cycle in adults with ALL might reduce the risk of high-grade hepatotoxicity without adversely impacting clinical efficacy outcomes.","Tinajero, J.; Xu, S.; Ngo, D.; Li, S.; Palmer, J.; Nguyen, T.; Stein, A.; Koller, P.; Agrawal, V.; Pourhassan, H.; Murphy, L.; Forman, S.; Douer, D.; Marcucci, G.; Pullarkat, V.; Aldoss, I.",2025,Br J Haematol,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
403,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011671.pub3,Normothermic and hypothermic machine perfusion preservation versus static cold storage for deceased donor kidney transplantation,"BACKGROUND: Kidney transplantation is the optimal treatment for kidney failure. Donation, transport and transplant of kidney grafts leads to significant ischaemia reperfusion injury. Static cold storage (SCS), whereby the kidney is stored on ice after removal from the donor until the time of implantation, represents the simplest preservation method. However, technology is now available to perfuse or ""pump"" the kidney during the transport phase (""continuous"") or at the recipient centre (""end-ischaemic""). This can be done at a variety of temperatures and using different perfusates. The effectiveness of these treatments manifests as improved kidney function post-transplant., OBJECTIVES: To compare machine perfusion (MP) technologies (hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) and (sub) normothermic machine perfusion (NMP)) with each other and with standard SCS., SEARCH METHODS: We contacted the information specialist and searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies until 15 June 2024 using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov., SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing machine perfusion techniques with each other or versus SCS for deceased donor kidney transplantation were eligible for inclusion. All donor types were included (donor after circulatory death (DCD) and brainstem death (DBD), standard and extended/expanded criteria donors). Both paired and unpaired studies were eligible for inclusion., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The results of the literature search were screened, and a standard data extraction form was used to collect data. Both of these steps were performed by two independent authors. Dichotomous outcome results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Survival analyses (time-to-event) were performed with the generic inverse variance meta-analysis of hazard ratios (HR). Continuous scales of measurement were expressed as a mean difference (MD). Random effects models were used for data analysis. The primary outcome was the incidence of delayed graft function (DGF). Secondary outcomes included graft survival, incidence of primary non-function (PNF), DGF duration, economic implications, graft function, patient survival and incidence of acute rejection. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach., MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-two studies (4007 participants) were included. The risk of bias was generally low across all studies and bias domains. The majority of the evidence compared non-oxygenated HMP with standard SCS (19 studies). The use of non-oxygenated HMP reduces the rate of DGF compared to SCS (16 studies, 3078 participants: RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.88; P < 0.0001; I2 = 31%; high certainty evidence). Subgroup analysis revealed that continuous (from donor hospital to implanting centre) HMP reduces DGF (high certainty evidence). In contrast, this benefit over SCS was not seen when non-oxygenated HMP was not performed continuously (low certainty evidence). Non-oxygenated HMP reduces DGF in both DCD and DBD settings in studies performed in the 'modern era' and when cold ischaemia times (CIT) were short. The number of perfusions required to prevent one episode of DGF was 7.69 and 12.5 in DCD and DBD grafts, respectively. Continuous non-oxygenated HMP versus SCS also improves one-year graft survival (3 studies, 1056 participants: HR 0.46, 0.29 to 0.75; P = 0.002; I2 = 0%; high certainty evidence). Assessing graft survival at maximal follow-up confirmed a benefit of continuous non-oxygenated HMP over SCS (4 studies, 1124 participants (follow-up 1 to 10 years): HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.77; P = 0.0005; I2 = 0%; high certainty evidence). This effect was not seen in studies where HMP was not continuous. The effect of non-oxygenated HMP on our other outcomes (PNF, incidence of acute rejection, patient survival, hospital stay, long-term graft function, duration of DGF) remains uncertain. Studies performing economic analyses suggest that HMP is either cost-saving (USA and European settings) or cost-effective (Brazil). One study investigated continuous oxygenated HMP versus non-oxygenated HMP (low risk of bias in all domains); the simple addition of oxygen during continuous HMP leads to additional benefits over non-oxygenated HMP in DCD donors (> 50 years), including further improvements in graft survival, improved one-year kidney function, and reduced acute rejection. One large, high-quality study investigated end-ischaemic oxygenated HMP versus SCS and found end-ischaemic oxygenated HMP (median machine perfusion time 4.6 hours) demonstrated no benefit compared to SCS. The impact of longer periods of end-ischaemic HMP is unknown. One study investigated NMP versus SCS (low risk of bias in all domains). One hour of end ischaemic NMP did not improve DGF compared with SCS alone. An indirect comparison revealed that continuous non-oxygenated HMP (the most studied intervention) was associated with improved graft survival compared with end-ischaemic NMP (indirect HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.92; P = 0.03). No studies investigated normothermic regional perfusion (NRP) or included any donors undergoing NRP., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Continuous non-oxygenated HMP is superior to SCS in deceased donor kidney transplantation, reducing DGF, improving graft survival and proving cost-effective. This is true for both DBD and DCD kidneys, both short and long CITs, and remains true in the modern era (studies performed after 2008). In DCD donors (> 50 years), the simple addition of oxygen to continuous HMP further improves graft survival, kidney function and acute rejection rate compared to non-oxygenated HMP. Timing of HMP is important, and benefits have not been demonstrated with short periods (median 4.6 hours) of end-ischaemic HMP. End-ischaemic NMP (one hour) does not confer meaningful benefits over SCS alone and is inferior to continuous HMP in an indirect comparison of graft survival. Further studies assessing NMP for viability assessment and therapeutic delivery are warranted and in progress. Copyright © 2024 The Cochrane Collaboration.

134,40390343.0,10.25259/nmji_528_2024,The Status of Liver Transplantation in India,"Background The passage of the Transplantation of Human Organs Act in 1994 banned the unethical trade in human kidneys and recognized heart beating brain death as a form of death. This enabled liver transplantation to be performed in India. We briefly recount the history of the Act's passage and describe, in some detail, the present status of the procedure. Methods We sent a questionnaire regarding liver transplant services via email to 400 members of the Liver Transplant Society of India requesting them to provide details on liver transplantation at their centres up to 2022. We received information on 3069 of 3920 transplants that had been performed in 2022. Results There were 183 registered centres who had performed a total of 3920 liver transplants, placing India in third position behind the USA (n=9528) and China (n=6053) while it performed the largest number of living donor liver transplants (n=3183) in the world. The most common indication for liver transplantation was non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-related cirrhosis (20%). Our teams published 2449 PubMed indexed research papers and 384 foreign trainees came from 52 countries for training in liver transplantation. The concerns were the small numbers of deceased organ donation, the dominance of the private sector (96.7%), corruption in the form of kickbacks and false declarations of relationship and gender imbalance with only 22% women recipients receiving organs from men while 68% women donated their livers to men. Conclusion Liver transplantation has saved the lives of many Indians, made a major impact on Indian healthcare overall, and increased its reputation worldwide. There are problems which we hope will be tackled by increasing societal awareness.","Tiwari, P.; Nundy, S.",2025,Natl Med J India,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Historically, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has been administered intraoperatively to DCD graft recipients to reduce non-anastomotic biliary complications (NAS). Treating the liver during NMP offers a potentially safer administration, preventing systemic treatment of the recipient. In this retrospective study, we explore our center's experience of giving tPA with FFP during NMP and its effects on clinical chemistries during perfusion, intraoperative transfusions, and post-operative outcomes and clinical chemistries. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-seven livers were perfused using the OrganOx metra, including 56 DCD livers (tPA + NMP-DCD) that received a bolus of 10 mg tPA followed by a 90-min infusion of 40 mg. Sixty-five livers from donation after brain death donors underwent NMP without tPA (NMP-DBD). A historical, propensity-matched cohort of 78 livers from non-NMP DCD donor livers (n = 51) were an additional comparator group (tPA-DCD). RESULTS: Intraoperative transfusions, 30-day and 3-month patient survival, and 30-day and 3-month graft survival were not statistically different between the tPA-NMP-DCD and NMP-DBD groups, except for cell saver volumes (p = 0.0034). Less platelets and cryoprecipitate transfusions were observed in the tPA-NMP-DCD livers compared to historical tPA-DCD livers (p = 0.0021 and 0.0046, respectively). One incidence of primary non-function occurred in the tPA-DCD group, and the tPA-NMP-DCD arm had one case of ischemic cholangiopathy required re-transplant. There was a higher reoperation rate for hematoma evacuation in the NMP-DBD cohort. Minimum follow-up time was 5 months. CONCLUSION: Our results continue to lend support to NMP providing a platform for administering tPA to donor livers, curtailing a potential risk to the recipient. SUMMARY: Administration of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) can be safely administered during normothermic machine perfusion. For centers who traditionally deploy tPA in recipients for DCD donor livers, delivering during NMP is an alternative safer option sparing the reciepient from exposure.","Todd, R.; van Leeuwen, L.; Rosowicz, A.; Irizar, A.; Arvelakis, A.; DiNorcia, J.; Facciuto, M.; Moon, J.; Rocha, C.; Tabrizian, P.; Kim-Schluger, L.; Florman, S.

NMP has gained momentum recently by enabling safer use of higher risk organs via organ viability assessment. It also offers a platform for investigating ex vivo organ biology. METHODS: In this exploratory study, we completed a complex vascular reconstruction of explanted, diseased livers from patients undergoing transplantation and then perfused them normothermically on a closed perfusion circuit. We compared these livers to non-diseased donor livers via perfusate samples collected during perfusion. RESULTS: Five hepatectomized grafts and eight donor livers were perfused for 1 h or longer. Four hepatectomized livers cleared lactate, and all consumed glucose; all control livers cleared lactate, and seven utilized glucose. Significantly higher portal vein flows were achieved in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings illustrate the feasibility of using closed-circuit NMP as a platform to study hepatectomized organs, which could reshape the research landscape in mechanisms of disease and applied therapeutics for patients with end-stage liver disease.","Todd, R.; van Leeuwen, L.

We have previously described rehabilitation of discarded human donor lungs to a quality suitable for transplantation using cross-circulation of whole blood between xeno-support swine and human lungs. However, the immunologic implications of transplanting rehabilitated lungs remain unknown. METHODS: Human donor lungs declined for clinical transplantation (N = 5) and underwent xenogeneic cross-circulation (XC) for up to 12 hours. To model subsequent human transplantation, lungs were re-exposed to autologous human whole blood via normothermic ex vivo machine perfusion for up to 6 hours. Upon human blood re-exposure (HBR), lungs were evaluated for evidence of hyperacute rejection (HAR) through physiologic assessments and tissue analyses including histology, immunostaining, and flow cytometry. RESULTS: Upon HBR, lungs showed no significant change in physiologic function relative to the end of cross-circulation (PaO(2)/FiO(2): p = 0.41; vascular resistance: p = 0.27; dynamic compliance: p = 0.24) and histologic features of HAR were absent in all lungs. Despite pulmonary deposition of porcine IgG during cross-circulation, HBR resulted in decreased complement deposition (p = 0.019) with no change in membrane attack complex formation (p = 0.65) or apoptotic signaling (p = 0.93). Endothelial integrity was maintained after HBR with preservation of microvascular tight junctions, decreasing endothelial injury marker p-selectin (p = 0.34), and intact vascular response to alpha-adrenergic stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that transient exposure of human donor lungs to XC does not result in HAR upon simulated human transplantation, representing an important step toward clinical translation of this donor organ rehabilitation platform.","Tracy, K.

Data from lung transplantation suggest that storage at 10 °C improves mitochondrial preservation and subsequent allograft function compared with conventional storage on ice. Using a porcine model of donation after circulatory death, we compared static storage of livers at 10 °C to ice. Livers (N = 5 per group) underwent 10 hours of storage followed by 4 hours of normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) for real-time allograft assessment. Allografts were compared using established NMP viability criteria, tissue immunostaining, and tissue metabolomics. Livers stored at 10 °C demonstrated lower portal venous vascular resistance and greater hepatic artery vasoresponsiveness. Lactate clearance during NMP was similar between the groups. Livers stored at 10 °C showed favorable biochemical parameters of biliary viability, including greater bile volume, pH, and bicarbonate. Metabolomics analysis revealed increased aerobic respiration, improved electron transport chain function, and less DNA damage after reperfusion of livers stored at 10 °C. Static storage of donation after circulatory death livers with extended cold ischemic time at 10 °C demonstrates superior allograft function with evidence of improved biliary viability and mitochondrial function compared with ice. These data suggest that storage at 10 °C should be considered for translation to clinical practice.","Tracy, K. M.; Shishido, Y.; Petrovic, M.; Murphy, A.; Adesanya, T.; Fortier, A. K.; Harris, T.

43,41121208.0,10.1186/s12943-025-02430-7,Ex vivo modelling of human colorectal cancer liver metastasis by normothermic machine perfusion,"BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) is associated with poor survival, primarily due to acquired therapy resistance. While novel therapies arise, translation is limited by the lack of tumor models accurately representing dynamic microenvironmental interplay. Here, we show that ex vivo normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) offers a novel preclinical framework to study the intratumoral dynamics of CRLM biology. METHODS: Six resected metastatic human livers were preserved for two days and subjected to multi-omic profiling of serially sampled adjacent liver and metastatic tissue using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics (ST). Tissue integrity was assessed and cross-validated by immunofluorescence (IF), high-resolution respirometry (HRR) and flow-cytometry. RESULTS: NMP was successfuly applied to metastatic livers with minimal surgical adaptations, preserving both intrinsic hepatic properties and tissue viability over an extended duration. Single-cell and spatial mapping confirmed preservation of CRLM phenotypic properties and demonstrated high clinical translatability by applicability of the intrinsic epithelial consensus molecular subtypes to metastasis. Spatially deconvoluted pathway activities reflected functional tissue-microenvironments. Transcriptomic profiles - including those of tumor-associated myeloid cells - were preserved during NMP. Finally, we demonstrate tumor-associated myeloid cell persistence as a driver of disease progression and poor survival in colorectal cancer. CONCLUSION: Our findings represent the basis for future innovative applications adopting NMP in the context of CRLM, providing a new preclinical tumor model avenue.","Trebo, M.; Maurer, T.; Krendl, F.

It prevents the risk of haemorrhage, gas embolism and avoids the haemodynamic consequences of clamping the IVC and veno-venous bypass. No published cases have reported using hypothermic oxygenated perfusion machine. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The patient was a 58-year-old woman presenting a recurrent metastatic pleural chondrosarcoma, with a pleural metastasis and several intra-abdominal metastases, including a lesion localized in segment 1 close to the hilar plate and invading the left HV near its abutment in the IVC. A left hepatectomy enlarged to segment 1 was performed under TVE preserving the caval flow with in situ hypothermic portal perfusion of the liver using perfusion machine. RESULTS: PV clamping lasted 57 min, and 2 l of preservative solution were perfused. The maximum pressure in the PV was 10 mmHg and oxygen flow was regulated at 2 L/min. The resection was complete and margins were negative. Liver temperature was monitored at 5-6 °C. Postoperative follow-up was favourable, with hospital discharge at 16 days after surgery. DISCUSSION: The use of hypothermic oxygenated perfusion machine is therefore possible in this technique. In parallel with the results obtained in liver transplantation on marginal grafts, it could probably reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury of the remnant parenchyma compared with static cold storage and improve post-operative outcome.","Tribolet, A.; Salloum, C.; Allard, M.

313,41117379.0,10.1111/ctr.70351,Arterialization of the Portal Vein: A Potentially Graft-Saving Strategy to Optimize Veno-Arterial Inflow in Liver Transplantation,"INTRODUCTION: The dual vascular inflow of liver grafts in liver transplantation (LT) is increasingly recognized as crucial to achieving adequate graft function in deceased donor LT (DDLT). Portal hyperperfusion is the most common, leading to decreased intrahepatic adenosine and arterial vasoconstriction via the hepatic artery buffer response. Splanchnic vasodilators, splenic artery embolization, or splenectomy are all recognized among other treatments. However, the management of portal hypoperfusion is less well described, with only isolated case reports describing the augmentation of portal venous (PV) inflow. This is the largest series describing PV arterialization as a strategy to save liver grafts by bolstering portal inflow. METHODS: Patients at a single transplant center (Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi, UAE) were included (2018-2024). Intra-operative portal vein and hepatic artery flows are measured in all cases using a MediStim vascular flow device, and liver-vascular ultrasounds are obtained routinely post-transplant. Surgical PV arterialization is used as a short-term measure when adequate portal vein flow cannot be achieved using conventional techniques. Cases were performed using end-to-side anastomosis of a cadaveric iliac artery graft from the recipient infra-renal aorta (n = 3) to the recipient PV as an additional inflow in Y-configuration or using a conduit from the donor splenic artery to the donor PV (end-to-side) with the standard PV-anastomosis also functioning. RESULTS: Four patients were deemed to have inadequate portal flow in the early post-LT (range POD1-7, n = 3) or intra-operative (n = 1) periods. All patients had laboratory and/or visual evidence of inadequate liver function secondary to portal hypoperfusion at the time of the decision to pursue arterialization. PV flows before arterialization were 500-590 mL/min [31-39 mL/min/100 g] and 1.4-2 L/min [93-133 mL/min/100 g] after arterialization. Arterialization grafts (n = 3) were ligated on post-arterialization days 2-7. At the conclusion of modulation, PV flows were 1.1-2.3 L/min [73-147 mL/min/100 g] with maintained HA flows 120-495 mL/min, highlighting the relative adaptability of liver graft and PV compliance after augmentation. All four patients are symptom-free with intact liver graft function at a range of 6-18 months post-LT. Graft survival of 100% compares favorably to all-comers after LT in the same setting (1-year GS = 96%, log-rank p = 0.874). CONCLUSIONS: Arterialization of the portal vein is a viable and graft-saving strategy for PV hypoperfusion in LT. Surgeons may pursue this approach in the scenario of inadequate portal vein perfusion without other identifiable causes, such as PV thrombus or port-systemic shunts, with a plan for arterial shunt reversal 1-7 days after placement based on flow assessment.","Uso, T.

We present the Hannover Modification of TVE, which combines veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vvECMO) and a closed-loop in situ hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (CLIP) of the liver using the Bridge-to-Life(®) VitaSmart system for targeted parenchymal protection. METHODS: A 62-year-old woman with FGFR2-fused intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) involving the hepatocaval confluence and all three hepatic veins, previously deemed unresectable, underwent partial ALPPS-preserving segment IVb. One week later, extended right trisectionectomy with reconstruction of the left hepatic vein was performed under TVE. Dual perfusion circuits were established: (1) a portocaval anastomosis was established and systemic and portal venous return was maintained via vvECMO; (2) cold (4 °C), oxygenated HTK solution was infused via a left portal vein catheter, drained through the hepatic veins into the IVC, and recirculated through a caval outflow cannula. RESULTS: The CLIP approach ensured continuous oxygenation and hypothermia of the liver during resection and venous reconstruction without systemic cooling. Operative time was 4 hours and 3 minutes, with 72 minutes of CLIP and 130 minutes of vvECMO. Histopathology revealed a 6.5-cm iCCA (ypT1a, G2) with negative margins (R0). The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 7 with excellent liver function. CONCLUSIONS: The Hannover CLIP technique effectively combines controlled, recirculated HOPE with vvECMO. This approach minimizes ischemic injury to the liver, kidneys, and intestines and facilitates safe resection of highly complex central liver tumors under TVE.","van Beekum, C.

248,40648994.0,10.3390/jcm14134620,An Iterative Design Approach to Development of an Ex Situ Normothermic Multivisceral Perfusion Platform,"Background/Objectives: Challenges in normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) remain, particularly concerning the duration for which individual organs can be safely preserved. We hypothesize that optimal preservation can be achieved by perfusing organs together in a multivisceral block. Therefore, our aim was to establish a platform for ex situ multivisceral organ perfusion. Methods: Multivisceral grafts containing the liver, kidneys, pancreas, spleen, and intestine were obtained from Yorkshire pigs. Three generation (gen) set-ups were tested during the iterative design process, and minor changes were made throughout. Gen 1 (n = 4) used a custom-designed single perfusion circuit. Gen 2 (n = 3) employed a dual perfusion circuit. Gen 3 (n = 4) featured a single perfusion circuit with an optimized basin and reservoir. Grafts underwent NMP using an autologous blood-based perfusate, while hemostatic parameters and function were assessed. Results: Comparing Gen 1 versus Gen 3, the mean aortic flow improved (1.018 vs. 2.089 L), resistance decreased (0.224 vs. 0.038), urine output increased (51.90 vs. 271.3 mL), oxygen consumption rose (43.56 vs. 49.52 mL O(2)/min), perfusate lactate levels dropped (10.44 vs. 3.10 mmol/L), and the pH became more physiological (7.27 vs. 7.30). Cellular injury trended lower in Gen 3. Histological evaluation demonstrated minimal differences in Gens 2 and 3. Conclusions: We demonstrate the feasibility of abdominal multivisceral NMP for up to 8 h. Adequate arterial flow, stable perfusate pH, and high oxygen consumption in setup 3 indicated organ viability. Multivisceral perfusion may serve as a plat-form for long-term NMP.","van Leeuwen, L.

17,40011689.0,10.1038/s41596-024-01130-8,'Back-to-base' combined hypothermic and normothermic machine perfusion of human donor livers,"The shortage of suitable donor organs has resulted in the use of suboptimal, high-risk, extended-criteria donor (ECD) livers, which are at an increased risk of failure after transplantation. Compared with traditional static cold storage, dynamic preservation by ex situ machine perfusion reduces the risks associated with the transplantation of ECD organs. Ex situ machine perfusion strategies differ in timing (that is, speed of procurement and transport), perfusion duration and perfusion temperature. For 'back-to-base' protocols, the donor liver is statically cold stored during transportation to the recipient hospital (the 'base') and then perfused, instead of transporting the liver using a portable perfusion system. While dual hypothermic (8-12 °C) oxygenated machine perfusion (DHOPE) allows safe prolongation of preservation duration and reduces ischemia-reperfusion injury-related complications, including post-transplant cholangiopathy, normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) at 35-37 °C facilitates ex situ viability testing of both liver parenchyma and bile ducts. Here, we describe a clinical protocol for 'back-to-base' combined DHOPE and NMP, linked by a period of controlled oxygenated rewarming (COR), which we call the DHOPE-COR-NMP protocol. This protocol enables restoration of mitochondrial function after static ischemic preservation and minimizes both ischemia-reperfusion and temperature-shift-induced injury during the start of NMP. The NMP phase allows viability assessment before final donor liver acceptance for transplantation. Sequential DHOPE and COR-NMP may reduce the risks associated with transplantation of ECD livers and facilitate enhanced utilization, thereby helping to alleviate the organ shortage.","van Leeuwen, O.

Dual hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion (DHOPE) of donor livers before transplantation has been shown to reduce the incidence of symptomatic NAS and acute cellular rejection (ACR) within 6 months, but long-term results are unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the 5-year incidence of NAS and ACR in the DHOPE-DCD Trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT02584283). METHODS: Between January 2016 and July 2019 recipients of DCD livers in 6 European centers were randomly assigned to receive that liver either after DHOPE (machine perfusion group) or after conventional static cold storage (control group). Primary endpoint was the incidence of NAS at 5-year follow-up. Secondary endpoints included ACR, graft, and patient survival. RESULTS: A total of 78 patients were included in the machine perfusion group and 78 patients in the control group. After 5 years of follow-up, the incidence of NAS was significantly lower in the machine perfusion group, compared with control group: 14% versus 26% (hazard ratio: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.23-0.99; P=0.048). In patients with immune-mediated disease, who are at increased risk of ACR, the rate of ACR was significantly lower in the machine perfusion group: 0% versus 32% (P=0.036).

314,41222569.0,10.1111/ctr.70380,Attitudes and Perceptions of Infectious Disease Providers Toward Transplantation From Living Donors With HIV to Recipients With HIV,"BACKGROUND: The HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) Organ Policy Equity (HOPE) Act legalized transplantation from both living and deceased donors with HIV to recipients with HIV (HIV D+/R+). Since its enactment, only a few living organ donations from people with HIV (PWH) have occurred compared to more deceased donations. The study aims to understand the perspectives of infectious disease providers and their awareness of HIV-positive donors with a reactive status (HIV D+/R+) to inform the practice, as kidney and liver transplants from these donors can now be conducted outside of research protocols. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with infectious disease providers (n = 18) from October 2023 to March 2024 to assess their perceptions and knowledge of HIV D+/R+ living organ donation. Inductive thematic analysis was conducted to identify major themes. RESULTS: Most providers had a positive view of HIV D+/R+ living donation, noting its potential to expand the donor pool, reduce wait times, and reduce stigma surrounding organ transplantation for PWH. However, they expressed concerns about the long-term outcomes of donors and emphasized the importance of thorough evaluations, including assessments of the disease stage and comorbidities. Additionally, providers mentioned that they had limited knowledge of the HIV D+/R+ donation process and highlighted the need for educational resources and establishing formal relationships with transplant programs.

25,41053978.0,10.1111/petr.70202,The Role of Machine Perfusion for Liver Transplantation in Children,"Pediatric liver transplantation (PLT) is the only lifesaving procedure for children with advanced liver disease and tumors. Despite significant progress and overall success in PLT, the field continues to face challenges due to procedural complexity across a heterogeneous age group, especially in infants and small children. Despite the use of living donor grafts, waitlist mortality remains disproportionately high in these younger patients. The unique challenges in PLT-including limited donor availability and higher risk of complications-underscore the need for improved strategies to evaluate and optimize donor liver quality before implantation. Machine perfusion has emerged as a promising tool in this context. While the benefits of hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE) for whole and partial livers have been reported with applications during and after liver split, the evidence for normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) remains scarce. Since the first report in 2019, multiple case series and clinical studies support the efficacy of HOPE in reducing early graft dysfunction, biliary complications, and graft loss after liver transplantation in children. Despite this progress, there is a pressing need for coordinated research efforts to study how HOPE and NMP affect transplant outcomes in pediatric recipients, especially when expanding split criteria or using DCD grafts, which are vital for expanding the donor pool despite the known higher risk.","Verma, S.; George, M.

This article examines recent advances in preservation techniques, therapeutic applications, and future directions of machine perfusion technologies. RECENT FINDINGS: Clinical trials demonstrate superior outcomes with machine perfusion compared with conventional preservation, particularly for marginal and donation after circulatory death grafts. Different protocols - hypothermic, subnormothermic, and normothermic perfusion - show specific advantages in various clinical settings. Technology enables therapeutic interventions like defatting steatotic livers and administering cell-based therapies. Advanced monitoring systems allow real-time graft function assessment, supporting evidence-based acceptance decisions. Novel developments include artificial intelligence applications, new perfusion solutions, and blockchain technology for standardization. SUMMARY: Machine perfusion represents a significant advancement in liver transplantation, though implementation challenges remain regarding infrastructure, training, and costs. The technology's ability to optimize marginal grafts and enable therapeutic interventions may expand the donor pool. Future research should focus on standardizing protocols, developing cost-effective solutions, and validating emerging technologies for widespread clinical adoption.","Via, L.; Zanza, C.; Tesauro, M.; Rubulotta, F.; Planinsic, R.; Longhitano, Y.",2025,Curr Opin Anaesthesiol,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed an updated systematic review and meta-analysis to compare NMP with static cold storage (SCS) in liver transplantation. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or observational studies. Risk ratios (RR) and mean differences were calculated. p < 0.05 was considered significant. A random-effects model was applied for all outcomes. PROSPERO ID: CRD42023486184. RESULTS: We included 1295 patients from 5 RCTs and 6 observational studies from 2016 to 2023. 592 (45.7%) underwent NMP. A subgroup RCT analysis favored NMP for non-anastomotic strictures (RR 0.4; 95% CI 0.2, 0.9), postreperfusion syndrome (RR 0.4; 95% CI 0.27, 0.56), and early allograft dysfunction (RR 0.6; 95% CI 0.4, 0.9). NMP favored higher organ utilization rates (RR 1.1; 95% CI 1.02, 1.18). No significant differences between NMP and SCS were observed in graft survival or patient survival at 12 months, primary non-function, serious adverse events, overall biliary complications, AST, or bilirubin levels peak within the first 7 days, ICU or hospital length of stay. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that NMP is associated with lower non-anastomotic biliary stricture rates, postreperfusion syndrome, early allograft dysfunction, and higher organ utilization in the RCT subgroup analysis, without increasing adverse events.","Viana, P.; Castillo-Flores, S.; Mora, M.

Extracorporeal machine perfusion prior to transplantation may serve as a valuable platform to second to the surgeon's decision on acceptance or discard of the organ, but, to date, the availability of valuable perfusate biomarkers is rather poor. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP2) is a protein actively secreted upon epithelial cell stress and involved in the suppression of endothelial cell proliferation. METHODS: A total of 20 livers grafts from extended criteria donors, which were shipped to the implantation clinic by conventional cold storage, were subjected to 90 min of ex vivo machine perfusion after arrival. At the end of liver perfusion, perfusate concentrations of TIMP2 were measured and related to the occurrence of early allograft dysfunction after transplantation. RESULTS: ROC analysis disclosed a significant (p = 0.0046; CI 0.9-0.1) predictive potential of TIMP2 with a sensitivity to predict EAD of 1.0 (CI 0.51-1.0) and a specificity of 0.94 (CI 0.72-1.0) at a cut-off value of 2106 pg/ml. CONCLUSIONS: Determination of TIMP2, which is possible to be performed as point-of-care measure, may thus become a useful adjunct on the way to better evaluate extended criteria donor livers.","von Horn, C.; Zlatev, H.; Malkus, L.; Minor, T.",2025,Eur J Med Res,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Normothermic regional perfusion (NRP) and ex situ machine perfusion (es-MP) have been instrumental in improving liver transplant outcomes and graft utilization. This study examines the current landscape of liver utilization from cardiac DCD donors in the United States. Using the United Network for Organ Sharing Standard Transplant Analysis and Research file, all adult (≥18 years old) DCD donors in the United States from which the heart was used for transplantation from October 1, 2020, to September 30, 2023, were compared by procurement technique (NRP versus super rapid recovery [SRR]) and storage strategy (es-MP versus static cold storage). One hundred eighty-eight livers were transplanted from 309 thoracoabdominal NRP donors (61% utilization) versus 305 (56%) liver transplants from 544 SRR donors. es-MP was used in 20% (n = 38) of NRP cases versus 32% (98) of SRR cases. Of the liver grafts, 281 (59%) were exposed to NRP, es-MP, or both. While there is widespread utilization of machine perfusion, more research is needed to determine optimal graft management strategies, particularly concerning the use of multiple technologies in complementary ways.

Results to date have focused on both donor and recipient outcomes, but there remains potential for NMP to also impact transplant providers., STUDY DESIGN: Using United Network for Organ Sharing Standard Transplant Analysis file data, adult deceased donors who underwent transplantation between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2022, were identified. Transplanted livers were divided by preservation methods (static cold storage [SCS] and NMP) and case time (day-reperfusion 8 AM to 6 PM). Patient factors, transplant characteristics, and short-term outcomes were analyzed between Mahalanobis-metric-matched groups., RESULTS: NMP livers represented 742 (1.4%) of 52,132 transplants. NMP donors were more marginal with higher Donor Risk Index scores (1.78 +/- 0.50 NMP vs 1.49 +/- 0.38 SCS, p < 0.001) and donation after cardiac death frequency (36.9% vs 8.4%, p < 0.001). NMP recipients more often had model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) exception status (29.9% vs 23.4%, p < 0.001), lower laboratory MELD scores (20.7 +/- 9.7 vs 24.3 +/- 10.9, p < 0.001), and had been waitlisted longer (111.5 [21.0 to 307.0] vs 60.0 [9.0 to 245.0] days, p < 0.001). One-year graft survival (90.2% vs 91.6%, p = 0.505) was similar between groups, whereas length of stay was lower for NMP recipients (8.0 [6.0 to 14.0] vs 10.0 [6.0 to 16.0], p = 0.017) after adjusting for confounders. Notably, peak case volume occurred at 11 AM with NMP livers (vs 9 PM with SCS). Overall, a higher proportion of transplants was performed during daytime hours with NMP (51.5% vs 43.0%, p < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: NMP results in increased use of marginal allografts, which facilitated transplantation in lower laboratory MELD recipients who have been waitlisted longer and often have exception points. Importantly, NMP also appeared to shift peak caseloads from nighttime to daytime, which may have significant effects on the quality of life for the entire liver transplant team., (C) 2024 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.","Wang, B.; Shubin, A.; Harvey, J.; MacConmara, M.; Hwang, C.; Patel, M.; Vagefi, P.",2024,J Am Coll Surg,EMBASE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, insufficient liver resources and immune rejection after transplantation, as well as a shortage of liver tissue or cell donors, are challenges faced in clinical treatment. The research progress of liver organoid technology in recent years may provide new ways to solve the above problems. Organoids are a kind of three-dimensional cell condensates formed by the self-organization of pluripotent or adult stem cells through three-dimensional culture in vitro, which can imitate the spatial structure and physiological function characteristics of the original organs, can be sub-cultured in vitro, replicated on a large scale, and have the ability of self-renewal. The emergence of organoid technology has brought new hope for providing mechanism exploration models and resolution of hepatocyte resources. In particular, induced pluripotent stem cell-derived organoids do not involve ethical concerns, and are combined with emerging technologies such as gene editing and organ chips, thereby overcoming the constraint of traditional disease research models and establishing a new platform for translational medicine. Additionally, it has expansive application prospects in building disease models, screening drugs, precision medicine, regenerative medicine, and organ transplantation. Thus, this paper summarizes the technical principles, preclinical research, and application progress and challenges of liver organoid technology.","Wang, Z. R.; Yu, Y. Y.; Hong, W. G.; Wang, F.

However, the impact of an NMP program on waitlist times and mortality has not been evaluated. Adult patients listed for liver transplant (LT) at 2 academic centers from January 1, 2015, to September 1, 2023, were included (n=2773) to allow all patients >=6 months follow-up from listing. Routine NMP was implemented on October 14, 2022. Waitlist outcomes were compared from pre-NMP pre-acuity circles (n=1460), pre-NMP with acuity circles (n=842), and with NMP (n=381). Median waitlist time was 79 days (IQR: 20-232 d) at baseline, 49 days (7-182) with acuity circles, and 14 days (5-56) with NMP (p<0.001). The rate of transplant-per-100-person-years improved from 61-per-100-person-years to 99-per-100-person-years with acuity circles and 194-per-100-person-years with NMP (p<0.001). Crude mortality without transplant decreased from 18.3% (n=268/1460) to 13.3% (n=112/843), to 6.3% (n=24/381) (p<0.001) with NMP. The incidence of mortality without LT was 15-per-100-person-years before acuity circles, 19-per-100 with acuity circles, and 9-per-100-person-years after NMP (p<0.001). Median Model for End-Stage Liver Disease at LT was lowest with NMP, but Model for End-Stage Liver Disease at listing was highest in this era (p<0.0001). The median donor risk index of transplanted livers at baseline was 1.54 (1.27-1.82), 1.66 (1.42-2.16) with acuity circles, and 2.06 (1.63-2.46) with NMP (p<0.001). Six-month post-LT survival was not different between eras (p=0.322). The total cost of health care while waitlisted was lowest in the NMP era ($53,683 vs. $32,687 vs. $23,688, p<0.001); cost-per-day did not differ between eras (p=0.152).

We aim to review recent advances, provide discussion of potential future directions, and summarize challenges currently facing the field., Recent findings: Both NMP and hypothermic-oxygenated perfusion (HOPE) improve overall outcomes after liver transplantation versus traditional static cold storage (SCS) and offer improved logistical flexibility. HOPE offers additional protection to the biliary system stemming from its' protection of mitochondria and lessening of ischemia-reperfusion injury. Normothermic regional perfusion (NRP) is touted to offer similar protective effects on the biliary system, though this has not been studied prospectively., The most critical question remaining is the optimal use cases for each of the three techniques (NMP, HOPE, and NRP), particularly as HOPE and NRP become more available in the US. There are additional questions regarding the most effective criteria for viability assessment and the true economic impact of these techniques. Finally, with each technique purported to allow well tolerated use of riskier grafts, there is an urgent need to define terminology for graft risk, as baseline population differences make comparison of current data challenging., Summary: Machine perfusion is now widely available in all western countries and has become an essential tool in liver transplantation. Identification of the ideal technique for each graft, optimization of viability assessment, cost-effectiveness analyses, and proper definition of graft risk are the next steps to maximizing the utility of these powerful tools., Copyright (C) 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Optimal graft viability assessment on this approach remains controversial., Methods: All liver transplants at our center were included, divided into static-cold storage (n=418), NMP (OrganOx Metra) with traditional viability criteria (October 2022 to January 2024, n=213), and prospective viability assessment using FMN (NMP+FMN, January 2024 to August 2024, n=143). Perfusate fluorescence spectroscopy was performed to quantify FMN during NMP. Spectroscopy results were correlated with tissue analyses. Standard risk factors and clinically relevant core outcomes were collected for analysis. Groups were propensity-matched, and posttransplant outcomes, including economics, were assessed using inverse probability of treatment weighting. Mixed-effects models assessed complications, graft loss, and FMN-guided liver utilization. A decision-analytic model was used to assess the cost-benefit of NMP and FMN testing., Results: Graft loss was predicted best by perfusate FMN (>1700 samples; c-statistic AUC 0-4 h NMP: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.93-0.97, P<0.0001) versus traditional viability markers. High FMN grafts demonstrated significantly more mitochondrial injury measured in tissues at the end of NMP. Since implemented prospectively, FMN-based viability assessment during NMP led to a comparable liver utilization rate of NMP=94 versus NMP+FMN=90% (P=0.346) despite higher overall donor and recipient risk. Over one third (n=43, 35%) were livers from donation after circulatory death donors (DCD). Elevated perfusate FMN of >1.75 [mu]g/mL at 4 hours was independently associated with reduced graft survival and death-censored graft survival. Liver transplants in the FMN-era were independently associated with improved graft survival on Cox regression (HR: 6.841, 95% CI: 1.447-37.300, P<0.001). Risk-adjusted outcomes, including biliary and overall complications, major (Clavien>IIIA) complications, liver-related major complications, and graft loss, were improved with FMN-based viability testing. Overall morbidity measured by the comprehensive complications index (CCI) was reduced with NMP but did significantly decrease with additional FMN use compared with static-cold storage. Such results were upheld when DBD and DCD grafts were evaluated independently. Liver transplantations with high FMN livers demonstrated greater cumulative costs (P<0.001). On mixed-effects modeling, 44% percent of transplant-related cost variation was explained by FMN in the top quintile (>1.75 [mu]g/mL). Risk-matched FMN-tested DBD grafts specifically demonstrated an incremental 16% reduction in major complications with a net $33,657 saving per graft in the decision-analytic model, while DCD grafts demonstrated 30% improvement in major complications and an incremental cost-reduction of $53,563 per graft., Conclusions: Our findings support routine utilization of FMN-based viability assessment during NMP. Despite higher donor/recipient risk, our center has reduced complications and improved graft survival with FMN-based decision-making.

Retransplants, splits, and combined grafts were excluded. End-ischemic NMP (OrganOx-Metra) was implemented in October 2022 for extended-criteria donation after brain death (DBDs), all donations after circulatory deaths (DCDs), and logistics. NMP cases were matched 1:2 with static cold storage controls (SCS) using the Balance-of-Risk [donation after brain death (DBD)-grafts] and UK-DCD Score (DCD-grafts)., Results: Overall, 803 transplantations were included, 174 (21.7%) receiving NMP. Matching was achieved between 118 NMP-DBDs with 236 SCS; and 37 NMP-DCD with 74 corresponding SCS. For both graft types, median inpatient comprehensive complications index values were comparable between groups. DCD-NMP grafts experienced reduced cumulative 90-day comprehensive complications index (27.6 vs 41.9, P=0.028). NMP also reduced the need for early relaparotomy and renal replacement therapy, with subsequently less frequent major complications (Clavien-Dindo >=IVa). This effect was more pronounced in DCD transplants. NMP had no protective effect on early biliary complications. Organ acquisition/preservation costs were higher with NMP, yet NMP-treated grafts had lower 90-day pretransplant costs in the context of shorter waiting list times. Overall costs were comparable for both cohorts., Conclusions: This is the first risk-adjusted outcome and cost analysis comparing NMP and SCS. In addition to logistical benefits, NMP was associated with a reduction in relaparotomy and bleeding in DBD grafts, and overall complications and post-LT renal replacement for DCDs.

METHODS: All liver transplants at our center were included, divided into static-cold storage (n=418), NMP (OrganOx Metra ) with traditional viability criteria (October 2022 to January 2024, n=213), and prospective viability assessment using FMN (NMP+FMN, January 2024 to August 2024, n=143). Perfusate fluorescence spectroscopy was performed to quantify FMN during NMP. Spectroscopy results were correlated with tissue analyses. Standard risk factors and clinically relevant core outcomes were collected for analysis. Groups were propensity-matched, and posttransplant outcomes, including economics, were assessed using inverse probability of treatment weighting. Mixed-effects models assessed complications, graft loss, and FMN-guided liver utilization. A decision-analytic model was used to assess the cost-benefit of NMP and FMN testing. RESULTS: Graft loss was predicted best by perfusate FMN (>1700 samples; c-statistic AUC 0-4 h NMP: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.93-0.97, P <0.0001) versus traditional viability markers. High FMN grafts demonstrated significantly more mitochondrial injury measured in tissues at the end of NMP. Since implemented prospectively, FMN-based viability assessment during NMP led to a comparable liver utilization rate of NMP=94 versus NMP+FMN=90% ( P =0.346) despite higher overall donor and recipient risk. Over one third (n=43, 35%) were livers from donation after circulatory death donors (DCD). Elevated perfusate FMN of >1.75 μg/mL at 4 hours was independently associated with reduced graft survival and death-censored graft survival. Liver transplants in the FMN-era were independently associated with improved graft survival on Cox regression (HR: 6.841, 95% CI: 1.447-37.300, P <0.001). Risk-adjusted outcomes, including biliary and overall complications, major (Clavien>IIIA) complications, liver-related major complications, and graft loss, were improved with FMN-based viability testing. Overall morbidity measured by the comprehensive complications index (CCI) was reduced with NMP but did significantly decrease with additional FMN use compared with static-cold storage. Such results were upheld when DBD and DCD grafts were evaluated independently. Liver transplantations with high FMN livers demonstrated greater cumulative costs ( P <0.001). On mixed-effects modeling, 44% percent of transplant-related cost variation was explained by FMN in the top quintile (>1.75 μg/mL). Risk-matched FMN-tested DBD grafts specifically demonstrated an incremental 16% reduction in major complications with a net $33,657 saving per graft in the decision-analytic model, while DCD grafts demonstrated 30% improvement in major complications and an incremental cost-reduction of $53,563 per graft. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support routine utilization of FMN-based viability assessment during NMP. Despite higher donor/recipient risk, our center has reduced complications and improved graft survival with FMN-based decision-making. Reduced transplant costs likely stem from a reduction in posttransplant complications.","Wehrle, C. J.; Satish, S.; Dewey, E.; Nadeem, M.

Hepatic insufficiency within a week of OLT, termed early allograft dysfunction (EAD), occurs in 20% to 25% of deceased donor OLT recipients and is associated with morbidity and mortality. Primary nonfunction (PNF), the most severe form of EAD, leads to death or retransplantation within 7 days. The etiology of EAD is multifactorial, including donor, recipient, and surgery-related factors, and largely driven by ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). IRI is an immunologic phenomenon characterized by dysregulation of cellular oxygen homeostasis and innate immune defenses in the allograft after temporary cessation (ischemia) and later restoration (reperfusion) of oxygen-rich blood flow. The rising global demand for OLT may lead to the use of marginal allografts, which are more susceptible to IRI, and thus lead to an increased incidence of EAD. It is thus imperative the anesthesiologist is knowledgeable about EAD, namely its pathophysiology and intraoperative strategies to mitigate its impact. Intraoperative strategies can be classified by 3 phases, specifically donor allograft procurement, storage, and recipient reperfusion. During procurement, the anesthesiologist can use pharmacologic preconditioning with volatile anesthetics, consider preharvest hyperoxemia, and attenuate the use of norepinephrine as able. The anesthesiologist can advocate for normothermic regional perfusion (NRP) and machine perfusion during allograft storage at their institution. During recipient reperfusion, the anesthesiologist can optimize oxygen exposure, consider adjunct anesthetics with antioxidant-like properties, and administer supplemental magnesium. Unfortunately, there is either mixed, little, or no data to support the routine use of many free radical scavengers. Given the sparse, limited, or at times conflicting evidence supporting some of these strategies, there are ample opportunities for more research to find intraoperative anesthetic strategies to mitigate the impact of EAD and improve postoperative outcomes in OLT recipients., (C) 2024 International Anesthesia Research Society","Wilson, E.; Weinberg, D.; Patel, G.",2024,Anesth Analg,EMBASE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adoption of machine perfusion (MP) technology has rapidly expanded in liver transplantation without real-world data on utilization and outcomes, which are critical to understand the appropriate application of MP technology., Methods. The Organ Procurement and Transplant Network/Standard Transplant Analysis and Research database was used to identify all deceased donor livers procured with intent for transplant between October 27, 2015 (date of first recorded MP) and June 30, 2023 (n = 67 795). Liver allografts were cohorted by donation after brain death (DBD; n = 59 957) or circulatory death (DCD; n = 7873) and analyzed by static cold storage (SCS) or MP preservation method. Donor demographics, organ utilization, and graft survival were evaluated., Results. By 2023, 12.5% of all livers and 37.2% of DCD livers underwent MP preservation (82.6% normothermic, 6.7% hypothermic, and 10.8% other/unknown). Compared with SCS, MP liver donors were older (DBD: 48 versus 40 y [P < 0.001]; DCD: 43 versus 38 y [P < 0.001]) with higher body mass index (DBD: 28.8 versus 26.9 kg/m2 [P < 0.001]; DCD: 27.7 versus 26.9 kg/m2 [P = 0.004]). Donor livers had similar levels of macrosteatosis (median 5%). Graft utilization was higher for MP than SCS after DBD (96.4% versus 93.0%, P < 0.001) and DCD (91.4% versus 70.3%, P < 0.001) donation. Graft survival was similar between MP and SCS livers from DBD donors (P = 0.516), whereas MP-preserved grafts had superior survival from DCD donors at 1 and 3 y posttransplant (P = 0.013 and 0.037). Patient survival was similar across all groups at 3 y (P = 0.322)., Conclusions. The use of MP in liver transplantation increased rates of liver utilization and improved graft survival after DCD.

14,39697458.0,10.5500/wjt.v14.i4.96687,Ethical frontiers in liver transplantation,"Liver transplantation represents a pivotal intervention in the management of end-stage liver disease, offering a lifeline to countless patients. Despite significant strides in surgical techniques and organ procurement, ethical dilemmas and debates continue to underscore this life-saving procedure. Navigating the ethical terrain surrounding this complex procedure is hence paramount. Dissecting the nuances of ethical principles of justice, autonomy and beneficence that underpin transplant protocols worldwide, we explore the modern challenges that plaques the world of liver transplantation. We investigate the ethical dimensions of organ transplantation, focusing on allocation, emerging technologies, and decision-making processes. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase and Central were searched from database inception to February 29, 2024 using the following keywords: ""liver transplant"", ""transplantation"", ""liver donation"", ""liver recipient"", ""organ donation"" and ""ethics"". Information from relevant articles surrounding ethical discussions in the realm of liver transplantation, especially with regards to organ recipients and allocation, organ donation, transplant tourism, new age technologies and developments, were extracted. From the definition of death to the long term follow up of organ recipients, liver transplantation has many ethical quandaries. With new transplant techniques, societal acceptance and perceptions also play a pivotal role. Cultural, religious and regional factors including but not limited to beliefs, wealth and accessibility are extremely influential in public attitudes towards donation, xenotransplantation, stem cell research, and adopting artificial intelligence. Understanding and addressing these perspectives whilst upholding bioethical principles is essential to ensure just distribution and fair allocation of resources. Robust regulatory oversight for ethical sourcing of organs, ensuring good patient selection and transplant techniques, and high-quality long-term surveillance to mitigate risks is essential. Efforts to promote equitable access to transplantation as well as prioritizing patients with true needs are essential to address disparities. In conclusion, liver transplantation is often the beacon of hope for individuals suffering from end-stage liver disease and improves quality of life. The ethics related to transplantation are complex and multifaceted, considering not just the donor and the recipient, but also the society as a whole.","Wong, H. P. N.; Selvakumar, S. V.; Loh, P.

Its incidence underscores the need for timely diagnosis and effective intervention. Diagnostic modalities such as magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography offer both anatomical and functional insights. Endoscopic management with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography remains the mainstay of treatment, while percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography offers an alternative in patients with altered anatomy or failed endoscopic access. Surgical revision is considered a last resort after other methods have failed. Preventive strategies, including machine perfusion and meticulous surgical techniques, are essential in reducing incidence and improving outcomes.

The reaction was accomplished using a multicomponent reaction pathway. The synthetics were explored for their utility as an anticancer agent via human topoisomerase-II and tubulin inhibition. Among the synthetics, compounds 1B4, 1B5, and 1B6 were potent anticancer agents tested in five cancer cell lines compared to colchicine and etoposide employed as positive controls. These synthetics were found further devoid of any significant cytotoxicity towards normal cells, thus proving their selective anticancer nature. Further, these compounds inhibited both the tubulin and hTopoII as indicated by in vitro-based assay. The mechanistic insights were corroborated using molecular docking studies. Besides this, the molecules were found to portray their secondary anticancer cell death mechanism via apoptosis. They decreased the oxidative stress, induced apoptosis, and arrested the cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase in cancer cells.","Yadav, U. P.; Yaseen, M.; Singh, S.; Babu, M. A.; Bhat, M.

We examined the impact of these NMP devices over 3 years after their release for commercial use on deceased donor liver transplantation (LT). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of UNOS-SRTR data of livers recovered from DCD donors or older (≥ 60 years old) donation after brain death (DBD) donors for LT as well as the outcome of LT from DBD or DCD donors performed from 1/1/2016 to 6/30/2024 to compare differences with ischemic cold storage (ICS) versus NMP. RESULTS: Among 10 778 donors of DCD livers, 1987 donors used NMP, and 8791 donors used ICS. In NMP group, the proportion of discarded livers was significantly less (7.25% vs. 30.52%), donors were older, donor BMI higher and more expanded criteria donor than those in ICS group (all, p < 0.001). For older donors, 416 cases used NMP and in 10 708 cases the liver was recovered via ICS. The discard rate of livers in NMP group was significantly less (4.33% vs. 12.18%, p < 0.001) and donors were older and donor BMI higher than that in ICS group. In DCD LT, the incidence of primary nonfunction (PNF), acute rejection within 1 year after LT as well as graft failure due to IC and hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) in NMP group were significantly less than those in ICS group. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, commercial use of NMP has expanded the donor pool by accelerated usage of marginal livers such as DCD and older donors by permitting longer preservation and functional assessment of the liver. In addition, the usage of NMP for DCD LTs was associate with a reduced incidence of rejection, PNF, graft failure due to IC and HAT.","Yamamoto, T.; Koizumi, N.; Markmann, J.

Liver transplantation stands as the primary treatment for end-stage liver disease, with demand surging in recent decades because of expanded indications. However, hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury can lead to liver transplant failure in both deceased donor and living donor transplantation. This study explored whether preconditioning donor livers through exercise training (ExT) could mitigate cold ischemic injury posttransplantation., Methods. Donor C57BL/6 mice underwent ExT via treadmill running or remained sedentary. After 4 wk, the donor liver underwent cold storage and subsequent orthotopic liver transplantation or ex vivo warm reperfusion., Results. Donor liver from mice subjected to ExT showed significantly decreased hepatic injury on reperfusion. Tissue histology revealed decreased sinusoidal congestion, vacuolization, and hepatocellular necrosis in livers from ExT mice, and immunofluorescence staining further revealed a decreased number of apoptotic cells in ExT grafts. Livers from ExT donors expressed decreased intragraft inflammatory cytokines cascade, decreased neutrophil infiltration and neutrophil extracellular traps, and increased M2 phenotype of recipient macrophages compared with grafts from sedentary mice. After cold storage, liver grafts from ExT donors showed decreased accumulation of reactive oxygen species and decreased levels of cytochrome c and high mobility group box 1 released in the liver effluent. In addition, ExT grafts showed upregulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1[alpha]) and higher levels of mitochondrial content. Similar effects of decreased hepatic injury were observed in wild-type mice when pretreated with a PGC-1[alpha] stimulator ZLN005 instead of ExT., Conclusions. These findings suggest that augmenting hepatocytic mitochondrial content through donor exercise or PGC-1[alpha] stimulation may offer therapeutic avenues to mitigate postreperfusion inflammation and improve transplant outcomes., Copyright (C) 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

70,39743232.0,10.4285/ctr.24.0039,Beyond the icebox: modern strategies in organ preservation for transplantation,"Organ transplantation, a critical treatment for end-stage organ failure, has witnessed significant advancements due to the integration of improved surgical techniques, immunosuppressive therapies, and donor-recipient matching. This review explores the progress of organ preservation, focusing on the shift from static cold storage (SCS) to advanced machine perfusion techniques such as hypothermic (HMP) and normothermic machine perfusion (NMP). Although SCS has been the standard approach, its limitations in preserving marginal organs and preventing ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) have led to the adoption of HMP and NMP. HMP, which is now the gold standard for high-risk donor kidneys, reduces metabolic activity and improves posttransplant outcomes. NMP allows real-time organ viability assessment and reconditioning, especially for liver transplants. Controlled oxygenated rewarming further minimizes IRI by addressing mitochondrial dysfunction. The review also highlights the potential of cryopreservation for long-term organ storage, despite challenges with ice formation. These advances are crucial for expanding the donor pool, improving transplant success rates, and addressing organ shortages. Continued innovation is necessary to meet the growing demands of transplantation and save more lives.","Yemaneberhan, K. H.; Kang, M.; Jang, J. H.; Kim, J. H.; Kim, K. S.; Park, H.

Since the 2010s, its implementation in Europe has expanded access to life-saving transplants. This review examines the impact of hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE) on liver transplantation, with a focus on viability assessment, posttransplant complications, oncologic outcomes, organ utilization, and cost-effectiveness. FINDINGS: HOPE offers significant advantages over traditional cold storage preservation including enhanced mitochondrial protection, reduced oxidative stress, and improved posttransplant recovery. Studies have demonstrated its effectiveness in lowering the incidence of graft dysfunction, biliary complications, and overall transplant-related issues. Additionally, HOPE provides viability assessment by incorporating biomarkers such as flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and syndecan-1 (Sdc-1), which may aid in graft selection and predicting posttransplant outcomes. This review explores the cellular mechanisms underlying HOPE, its influence on graft function and transplant success, and its role in enhancing viability assessment and cost-effectiveness. SUMMARY: HOPE represents a significant advancement in liver transplantation, offering a safer, more efficient alternative to traditional preservation methods. By improving both clinical outcomes and being cost efficient, this technique has the potential to become a standard of care in liver transplantation. Further research should focus on refining viability assessment protocols, optimizing logistical implementation, and expanding clinical adoption to maximize organ utilization and improve patient survival.","Yildirim, F.

However, hepatotoxic effect of chronic exposure to AOH at environmental levels remains poorly characterized. Herein, we aim to investigate the long-term effects of dietary AOH exposure on murine liver and key signaling event through integrated in vivo and in vitro models. AOH exposure significantly induced dose-dependent hepatopathy characterized by liver injury, inflammatory cell infiltration, and liver fibrosis. RNA-sequencing analyses further indicated that the pivotal molecular mechanism linking the hepatotoxic effect of AOH were endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated apoptosis via PERK/ATF4/CHOP signaling cascade. In vitro models confirmed AOH promoted the PERK/ATF4/CHOP signaling activation and subsequent apoptosis in primary murine hepatocytes and human hepatocyte cell line THLE-2. Pharmacological intervention studies demonstrated that both TUDCA (ER stress inhibitor) and GSK2606414 (PERK inhibitor) effectively mitigated AOH-induced cytotoxicity in hepatocytes. Notably, TUDCA administration demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in mitigating AOH-induced hepatic pathology in mice. Thus, we delineate ER stress as central mechanism driving AOH-induced hepatotoxicity and validate PERK cascade inhibition as viable protective strategy. These findings fundamentally refine risk assessment framework for mycotoxin exposure while proposing novel molecular targets for therapeutic intervention against environmental hepatotoxicants.","Yu, S.; Shen, X.; Huang, Y.; Zou, L.; Zhang, C.; Cheng, J.

Autistic children have a higher risk of obesity than neurotypical children. Our study aims to describe the changes in overweight/obesity rates in autistic children during the pandemic, and to identify contributing factors. Methods: This is a retrospective case record review of patients with a clinical diagnosis of autism, who were seen at a developmental-behavioral pediatrics clinic in a tertiary academic hospital, between 1 January 2019 and 24 October 2021. We compared the average monthly rates of overweight/obese status pre- and during the pandemic. We collected data on the patients' and parents' demographics, duration of screen time per day, degree of difficulties related to autism symptoms and cognition. We analyzed factors associated with being overweight/obese during the pandemic. Results: 1330 patient visits were included. The mean age was 45.4 months; 78% were male; 52% were Chinese. The average monthly rate of overweight/obese status increased by 1.8% during the pandemic (17.9% pre-pandemic; 19.7% during pandemic). Factors associated with being overweight/obese during the pandemic included: Malay ethnicity (OR 2.321, p < 0.01), developmental delay (OR 2.80, p < 0.01), and lower parental education level (father OR 1.73, p = 0.01; mother OR 1.63, p = 0.03). On multivariate analysis, only Malay ethnicity (OR 2.95, p = 0.01) was significant. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates a rising overweight/obesity rate amongst children with autism spectrum disorder during the pandemic.

This study assessed hyperspectral imaging (HSI) as a non-invasive method to evaluate BD viability during NLMP. Methods: Eleven donor livers underwent NLMP with HSI at the start and end. Seven were transplanted; four were discarded. HSI measured tissue oxygenation, perfusion, and composition. The spectral data were analyzed using ANOVA, post hoc t-tests, and multifactorial ANOVA to assess spectral changes related to BD position, transplant status, and occurrence of BC. Results: Significant spectral changes were found in the BD region during NLMP. Transplanted livers that developed BC showed changes between 525 and 850 nm, while discarded ones had changes between 625 and 725 nm. Specific spectral bands (500-575 nm, 775-1000 nm) were linked to transplant outcomes and BC.

Despite progress in therapies such as surgery, transplantation, and targeted treatments, prognosis remains bleak for many patients. The advent of immunotherapy has revolutionized the landscape of advanced HCC treatment, offering hope for improved outcomes. However, its efficacy is limited, with a modest response rate of approximately 20% as a single-agent therapy, underscoring the urgent need to decipher mechanisms of immunotherapy resistance. Tumor protein 53 gene (TP53), a pivotal tumor suppressor gene, and Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), a crucial immune checkpoint ligand, play central roles in HCC's evasion of immune responses. Understanding how tumor protein 53 (p53) influences PD-L1 expression and immune system interactions is essential for unraveling the complexities of immunotherapy resistance mechanisms. Elucidating these molecular interactions not only enhances our understanding of HCC's underlying mechanisms but also lays the foundation for developing targeted treatments that may improve outcomes for patients with advanced-stage liver cancer. Ultimately, deciphering the nexus of p53 and PD-L1 in immunotherapy resistance promises to advance treatment strategies and outcomes in the challenging landscape of HCC. This review delves into the intricate relationship between p53 and PD-L1 concerning immunotherapy resistance in HCC, offering insights that could pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing treatment efficacy and overcoming resistance in advanced stages of the disease.","Zhang, G.; Zhang, G.; Zhao, Y.; Wan, Y.; Jiang, B.; Wang, H.",2025,Am J Cancer Res,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, limited animal models incorporating both stimuli hinder the advancement of transplant-related research. Here, a simplified and reproducible isolated perfused liver model is established to simulate the stresses experienced by livers maximally during transplantation. We provide a detailed protocol for a straightforward technique that requires 20-30 min for harvesting, 24-48 h for static cold storage (SCS), and 2 h for normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) to induce LT-like stresses in the liver. Hepatic injury from SCS and NMP (LT-like stresses) is evaluated using three types of parameters. The pH values and hepatic enzyme levels of cold preservation solutions and perfusate serve as dynamic indicators of hepatic injury. Bile production and portal venous resistance directly reflect liver function, whereas pathological analysis visually illustrates the location and extent of injury. This animal model eliminates the influence of hemodynamic and immune factors, yielding highly reproducible results, and is strongly recommended as a standardized animal model for inducing LT-like stresses.","Zhang, L.; Ding, M.; Zhu, Y.; Yan, Z.; Guo, W.",2025,Liver Res,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Traditionally, researches on HCC were carried out using hepatocellular carcinoma cells, organoids, and animal models. However, these models cannot accurately replicate the pathophysiological conditions underlying the onset and progression of human HCC. Therefore, more effective disease models are needed to study HCC. METHODS: Ten disease livers from HCC patients who underwent transplantation were subjected to normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) via the hepatic artery and portal vein in vitro. Perfusion parameters, blood gas levels, and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) were continuously monitored to assess alterations in tumor activity. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) were employed to assess the preservation of hepatic tissue integrity and tumor mutational profiles during in vitro perfusion. Oxaliplatin +5-FU was used to conduct the liver cancer treatment research. RESULTS: Normothermic machine perfusion successfully maintained liver survival for 92 h in vitro. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound can be used to assess alterations in tumor and liver activity during normothermic machine perfusion. The sequencing analysis revealed that normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) effectively preserved hepatic tissue integrity while retaining tumor genomic stability. The normothermic machine perfusion model of HCC can be used for the study of anti-cancer therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Contrast-enhanced ultrasound can monitor alterations in tumor and liver activity, while normothermic machine perfusion can sustain the long-term survival of the liver in vitro, thus maintaining normal tumor characteristics. Therefore, this model provides a novel approach for studying tumor therapy.","Zhang, M.; Liu, M.; Chen, Y.; Li, Y.; Zhao, Q.; He, X.",2025,Int J Artif Organs,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,39489635.0,10.1016/j.hbpd.2024.10.002,Research progress of ischemia-free liver transplantation,"Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is an inherent issue in organ transplantation. Because of the allograft shortage, more and more extended criteria donor (ECD) organs are used, unfortunately these grafts are more susceptible to IRI. Although machine perfusion technology has brought hope to alleviate IRI, this technology is still unable to eradicate IRI-related organ damage. Ischemia-free liver transplantation (IFLT) can completely avoid IRI, thereby improve graft function and recipient outcome, and allow to expand organ pool. This review summarized the latest progresses in IFLT, and speculated the future development of this concept.","Zhang, M. X.; Zhao, Q.; He, X.

This study aimed to investigate the cardioprotective effect of exosomes derived from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells on donation after circulatory death (DCD) hearts preserved with normothermic ex vivo heart perfusion (EVHP) in a rat heart transplantation model., Methods. Thirty-two male Lewis rats were divided into 2 groups: the control group and the exosome group. The donor-heart rats were subjected to the DCD procedure by suffering a 15-min warm ischemia injury, subsequently preserved with EVHP for 90 min, and then transplanted into recipients via abdominal heterotopic heart transplantation. Vehicle or exosome was added into the perfusate of normothermic EVHP in the control or exosome group. We evaluated left ventricular graft function, myocardial inflammation, and myocardial apoptosis of the donor heart 1.5 h after heart transplantation. Furthermore, we investigate the alternation of myocardial gene expression in the donor hearts between both groups by transcriptome sequencing., Results. The treatment with exosome significantly enhanced cardiac function through increasing left ventricular developed pressure, dp/dtmax, and dp/dtmin of DCD hearts at 90 min after heart transplantation compared with the control group. The myocardial cells in the exosome group exhibited an orderly arrangement without obvious edema. Furthermore, exosome added into perfusate in the exosome group significantly attenuated the level of inflammatory response and apoptosis. Transcriptome sequencing and RT-qPCR showed the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B pathway was activated after exosome treatment., Conclusions. Normothermic EVHP combined with exosome can be a promising and novel DCD heart preservation strategy, alleviating myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in the DCD heart., Copyright (C) 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

237,41217423.0,10.1097/hep.0000000000001609,Hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury: Underlying mechanisms and concepts in liver surgery and liver transplantation,"Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (H-IRI) is a critical complication in liver surgery and liver transplantation, contributing to graft dysfunction and poor clinical outcomes. When hepatocyte protective mechanisms are insufficient to counteract energy depletion and oxidative stress during ischemia, cell death occurs. Tissue damage during H-IRI leads to the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which recruit and activate immune cells such as neutrophils and monocytes, orchestrating the initiation, progression, and eventual resolution of sterile inflammation. Extended criteria donor (ECD) livers, particularly steatotic ones, are more vulnerable to H-IRI, leading to poorer outcomes and limiting expansion of the donor pool. However, the mechanisms underlying this increased vulnerability are not yet fully understood. Emerging therapeutic strategies, including machine perfusion technologies, ischemic preconditioning, pharmacological interventions and others, offer promise for mitigating H-IRI by either attenuating early injury triggers, enhancing intrinsic survival pathways, or restraining excessive inflammatory responses. Despite considerable progress in understanding H-IRI, further research is needed to identify additional therapeutic targets, particularly in the context of ECD livers, to develop effective, targeted interventions that can improve clinical outcomes.","Zhao, J.; Hou, L.; Dery, K.

238,39868805.0,10.1111/aor.14955,Continuous Blood Gas Control Based on Active Disturbance Rejection Control During Ex Vivo Porcine Liver Perfusion,"BACKGROUND: Membrane oxygenators facilitate extracorporeal gas exchange, necessitating the monitoring of blood gas. Recent advances in normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) for ex vivo liver offer solutions to the shortage of donor liver. However, maintaining physiological blood gas levels during prolonged NMP is complex and costly. METHODS: We introduce a noninvasive and economical approach for regulating the blood gas during NMP of ex vivo porcine livers. By monitoring gas fractions at the outlet of oxygenator, real-time adjustments of blood gas can be made without the online blood gas analyzer. The method involves constructing multivariate linear regression (MLR) models, aligning target setpoints of gas, and employing active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) to achieve closed-loop regulation. RESULTS: Ex vivo porcine liver perfusion experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the method, maintaining blood gas within physiological levels over 24 h (oxygen partial pressure: 150.36 ± 3.33 mmHg, carbon dioxide partial pressure: 41.34 ± 0.91 mmHg). CONCLUSION: ADRC-based continuous regulation of gas fraction at the outlet of oxygenator is a feasible and effective approach for managing blood gas during ex vivo porcine liver perfusion.","Zhao, Y.; Lyu, X.; Sun, Z.; Zhang, X.; Cen, J.; Yang, T.; Xu, X.; Xing, W.; Zhao, S.; Wang, B.; Luo, G.",2025,Artif Organs,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While liver transplantation remains the only curative option for end-stage fibrosis, the development of alternative therapies is urgently needed. In this study, we investigated the role of vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP) in hepatic fibrosis using clinical samples and a CCl(4)-induced mouse model. We observed significant downregulation of VDBP in fibrotic human and murine livers, suggesting that VDBP may serve as a potential biomarker for disease progression. VDBP knockout (VDBP-KO) mice exhibited exacerbated fibrosis, iron overload, and ferroptosis activation, accompanied by dysregulation of the Hippo-YAP pathway. In vitro, VDBP overexpression reversed these effects, while in vivo treatment with the YAP inhibitor verteporfin attenuated fibrosis, normalized iron homeostasis, and suppressed ferroptosis in VDBP-KO mice. Our findings demonstrate that VDBP plays a pivotal role in maintaining iron balance, inhibiting YAP signaling, and preventing ferroptosis during fibrogenesis. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms of VDBP and its downstream pathways may provide novel therapeutic targets for liver fibrosis. This could significantly improve the clinical management of hepatic fibrosis and offer new hope for patients suffering from this debilitating disease.","Zheng, Q.; Tan, Q.; Wang, D.; Ma, Y.; Zhou, Y.; Chen, Y.; Long, D.; Yang, J.; Feng, L.",2025,Exp Cell Res,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
106,40317606.0,10.1111/hepr.14187,Explainable machine learning for the assessment of donor grafts in liver transplantation,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: The shortage of liver grafts compared to recipients necessitates precise organ assessment. This study aimed to develop a Machine learning (ML) model to predict postoperative delayed graft function (DGF) and visualize the decision-making process for clinical application. METHOD: Data from 5242 donor-recipient pairs who underwent liver transplantation (LT) at the top 10 liver transplant centers in China (January 2017 to December 2022) were collected. The dataset was divided into training and validation sets. Sixty-three variables, including demographics, donor characteristics, diagnosis, preoperative lab results, and surgical information were analyzed. The primary outcome was posttransplantation DGF and the second outcome was posttransplantation 1-month and 3-month survival. Recursive feature elimination selected critical variables, and models were built using ML algorithms and logistic regression. Model performance was evaluated by AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The best model was validated with an independent dataset of 394 LT cases (January to June 2023). The SHapley Additive exPlanations package interpreted the top model's decisions. RESULTS: Among 5242 cases, 328 (6.26%) developed DGF, with 15 cases (3.81%) in the external validation set. Thirty critical features were selected. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithm achieved the highest AUC (0.877) and accuracy (0.936) in the internal set, and a comparable AUC (0.776) and accuracy (0.957) in the external set. SHAP analysis identified short perfusion time, high donor serum sodium, excessive bleeding during transplantation, high donor γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, and blood glucose levels as top predictors of post-LT DGF. The proposed model AUC's 1-month survival prediction was 0.841 and the 3-month survival prediction was 0.834. CONCLUSIONS: The developed model for predicting postoperative DGF demonstrated excellent predictive performance, aiding clinicians in evaluating donor grafts and making informed decisions.","Zhixing, L.; Linsen, Y.; Peng, J.; Siyi, D.; Haoyuan, Y.; Kun, L.; Siqi, L.; Yongwei, H.; Mingshen, Z.; Wei, L.; Hua, L.; Shuhong, Y.; Guihua, C.; Xiao, X.; Shusen, Z.; Yang, Y.",2025,Hepatol Res,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
97,39724135.0,10.1097/tp.0000000000005290,Use of Ex Situ Machine Perfusion for Liver Transplantation: The National Experience,"BACKGROUND: Machine perfusion (MP) for liver transplantation has become more widespread in the United States, but national studies on this growing practice are lacking. We investigated national use and outcomes of MP for liver transplantation. METHODS: Adult (≥18 y) liver recipients transplanted between January 1, 2016 and September 30, 2023 in the United Network for Organ Sharing database were included. We used Cox regression to compare 1-y posttransplant recipient survival and all-cause graft failure by use of MP and performed subgroup analyses among circulatory death (DCD) and brain death (DBD) donors. RESULTS: Of 52 626 deceased donors with liver recovery, 1799 (3.5%) utilized MP. The proportion of all liver transplants using MP increased from 0.3% in 2016 to 15.5% in 2023. MP for DCD transplants increased from 0.8% in 2016 to 50.0% in 2023. Donors of MP grafts were older (47 [34-57] versus 42 [29-55] y, P < 0.001), had higher body mass indexes (28.3 [24.4-33.3] versus 27.3 [23.7-31.8] kg/m 2 , P < 0.001), and were more likely to be DCD (47.1% versus 9.3%, P < 0.001). Among DBD transplants, MP and non-MP DBD transplants had similar all-cause graft failure out to 1 y (adjusted hazards ratios, 1.12 [95% confidence interval, 0.87-1.43], P = 0.38). Among DCD transplants, MP recipients had improved survival out to 1 y (adjusted hazards ratios, 0.50 [95% confidence interval, 0.35-0.70], P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: MP use in liver transplantation is rapidly expanding and is associated with favorable outcomes compared with cold storage. MP is associated with increased posttransplant survival for DCD transplants, highlighting the potential for MP to expand utilization of DCD grafts.","Zhou, A. L.; Akbar, A. F.; Ruck, J. M.; Weeks, S.

275,41025013.0,10.3748/wjg.v31.i37.111038,Identification of key factors and explainability analysis for surgical decision-making in hepatic alveolar echinococcosis assisted by machine learning,"BACKGROUND: Echinococcosis, caused by Echinococcus parasites, includes alveolar echinococcosis (AE), the most lethal form, primarily affecting the liver with a 90% mortality rate without prompt treatment. While radical surgery combined with antiparasitic therapy is ideal, many patients present late, missing hepatectomy opportunities. Ex vivo liver resection and autotransplantation (ELRA) offers hope for such patients. Traditional surgical decision-making, relying on clinical experience, is prone to bias. Machine learning can enhance decision-making by identifying key factors influencing surgical choices. This study innovatively employs multiple machine learning methods by integrating various feature selection techniques and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) interpretive analysis to deeply explore the key decision factors influencing surgical strategies. AIM: To determine the key preoperative factors influencing surgical decision-making in hepatic AE (HAE) using machine learning. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study at the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University (July 2010 to August 2024). There were 710 HAE patients (545 hepatectomy and 165 ELRA) with complete clinical data. Data included demographics, laboratory indicators, imaging, and pathology. Feature selection was performed using recursive feature elimination, minimum redundancy maximum relevance, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression, with the intersection of these methods yielding 10 critical features. Eleven machine-learning algorithms were compared, with eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) optimized using Bayesian optimization. Model interpretability was assessed using SHAP analysis. RESULTS: The XGBoost model achieved an area under the curve of 0.935 in the training set and 0.734 in the validation set. The optimal threshold (0.28) yielded sensitivity of 93.6% and specificity of 90.9%. SHAP analysis identified type of vascular invasion as the most important feature, followed by platelet count and prothrombin time. Lesions invading the hepatic vein, inferior vena cava, or multiple vessels significantly increased the likelihood of ELRA. Calibration curves showed good agreement between predicted and observed probabilities (0.2-0.7 range). The model demonstrated high net clinical benefit in Decision Curve Analysis, with accuracy of 0.837, recall of 0.745, and F1 score of 0.788. CONCLUSION: Vascular invasion is the dominant factor influencing the choice of surgical approach in HAE. Machine-learning models, particularly XGBoost, can provide transparent and data-driven support for personalized decision-making.","Zhu, D.

187,39860477.0,10.3390/jcm14020471,Real-Time Biomarkers of Liver Graft Quality in Hypothermic Oxygenated Machine Perfusion,"Background: Hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion has emerged as a strategy to alleviate ischemic-reperfusion injury in liver grafts. Nevertheless, there is limited data on the effectiveness of hypothermic liver perfusion in evaluating organ quality. This study aimed to introduce a readily accessible real-time predictive biomarker measured in machine perfusate for post-transplant liver graft function. Methods: The study evaluated perfusate analytes over a 90-day postoperative period in 26 patients randomly assigned to receive a liver graft following dual hypothermic machine perfusion in a prospective randomized controlled trial. Machine perfusion was consistently conducted end-ischemically for at least 120 min, with real-time perfusate assessment at 30-min intervals. Graft functionality was assessed using established metrics, including Early Allograft Dysfunction (EAD). Results: Perfusate lactate concentration after 120 min of machine perfusion demonstrated significant predictive value for EAD (AUC ROC: 0.841, p = 0.009). Additionally, it correlated with post-transplant peak transaminase levels and extended hospital stays. Subgroup analysis revealed significantly higher lactate accumulation in livers with post-transplant EAD. Conclusions: Liver graft quality can be effectively assessed during hypothermic machine perfusion using simple perfusate lactate measurements. The reliability and accessibility of this evaluation support its potential integration into diverse transplant centers.","Zhylko, A.; Morawski, M.; Rykowski, P.; Krasnodębski, M.; Wyporski, A.; Borkowski, J.; Zhylko, D.; Kobryń, K.; Stankiewicz, R.; Stypułkowski, J.; Hołówko, W.; Patkowski, W.; Wróblewski, T.; Szczepankiewicz, B.; Górnicka, B.; Mielczarek-Puta, M.; Struga, M.; Krawczyk, M.; Grąt, M.",2025,J Clin Med,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One such nRTK is c-Src, which plays a profound role in BC, is associated with BC development and metastasis, and induces resistance to cancer therapeutics. Considering the critical role of c-Src in BC outcome, we herein rationally designed and developed the tetrazole tethered quinazoline derivatives, considering the pharmacophoric feature of the catalytic domain of c-Src. The synthesis via the azide-isocyanide cross-coupling reaction led to the development of 11 compounds (3a-3 k) in good to high yields. Biological analysis revealed that all the compounds possessed anticancer potential against BC cells. Among them, Compounds 3e and 3 g showed nanomolar range activity in the employed cells, that is, MDAMB-231 (IC(50): 0.826 and 0.812 nM), T47D (IC(50): 0.973 and 1003 nM), and MCF-7 (IC(50):0.654 and 0.568 nM), in comparison to the positive control. These compounds were found to be nontoxic to normal cells. The target delineation studies on cSrc revealed the potent and dose-dependent inhibition of the kinase activity by the selected compounds 3e (IC(50): 410 nM) and 3 g (IC(50): 302 nM) compared to the employed positive control bosutinib (IC(50): 446 nM). The analysis was rationally corroborated by the in-silico analysis, particularly the molecular docking and dynamics. Besides this, the secondary anticancer mechanisms revealed that the compounds 3e and 3 g could upsurge the ROS levels in the cancer cells, alter the mitochondrial membrane (depolarization), induce cell death primarily via apoptosis, and halt the cancer cell cycle beyond the G1 phase.","Zou, L.; Yadav, U.

Impaired enzyme function leads to cholesterol deficiency, affecting the development and function of the entire organism. The accumulation of cholesterol precursors enhances the formation of oxysterols, which are involved in the pathomechanism of neurological, ophthalmological, and vascular changes in patients. This review analyzes 53 studies published between 2020 and 2025 on the molecular mechanisms underlying the clinical features of SLOS, including cholesterol deficiency, oxysterol accumulation, and the latest diagnostic methods, including LC-MS/MS chromatography and biomarkers such as GFAP for monitoring disease progression. MRI is discussed as a supportive tool for neuroimaging, along with advances in prenatal diagnostics, such as the detection of cholesterol precursors in neonatal hair. Therapeutic options are also reviewed, with particular emphasis on cholesterol supplementation, cholic acid, and experimental treatments such as vitamin E supplementation, statin therapy, gene therapy, and liver transplantation. Current research indicates that expanding knowledge in this area not only improves patient prognosis but also provides hope for the development of effective therapies in the future.","Żukowska, A.; Król, M.; Kupnicka, P.; Bąk, K.; Janawa, K.; Chlubek, D.",2025,Int J Mol Sci,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
