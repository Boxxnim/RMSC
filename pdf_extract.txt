Background: Ex vivo liver perfusion offers benefits over static cold storage (SCS) for organ preservation, but specific advantages
of different perfusion protocols require further evaluation.
Materials and Methods: Randomized controlled trials and matched studies conducted until December 2024 comparing ex vivo
machine perfusion and SCS were evaluated. A Bayesian network meta-analysis was conducted to assess the effects of varying
temperature settings, cannulation techniques, and perfusion duration in extended criteria donor (ECD) liver grafts. The relative
perfusion time within total preservation time was assessed to distinguish between long-term and short-term perfusion.
Results: The meta-analysis included 11 hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE) studies and 10 normothermic machine
perfusion (NMP) studies. Compared to SCS, HOPE reduced the risks of early allograft dysfunction (EAD) [risk ratio 0.46
(95% CI 0.31–0.67)], major complications [0.40 (0.25–0.63)], and acute cellular rejection (ACR) [0.47 (0.27–0.80)] (high-certainty).
Compared to NMP, HOPE reduced the risks of EAD, non-anastomotic biliary stricture (NAS), total biliary complications (TBC), and
ACR (moderate-certainty). HOPE reduced the risks of NAS in both single [0.18 (0.05–0.51)] and dual [0.32 (0.12–0.77)] cannulation
settings compared with SCS (high-certainty). Compared to SCS, short-term and long-term HOPE prevented EAD [long-term:
0.41 (0.22–0.74); short-term: 0.50 (0.29–0.84)], major complications [long-term: 0.48 (0.24–0.92); short-term: 0.32 (0.15–0.64)],
and NAS [long-term: 0.14 (0.02–0.56); short-term: 0.30 (0.13–0.66)] (high-certainty). Compared to short-term NMP, long-term
NMP reduced the risk of NAS [0.26 (0.07–0.93)] (high-certainty).
Conclusion: HOPE is more effective than NMP in preventing EAD, TBC, NAS, and ACR in ECD grafts. Both single and dual HOPE
are effective, and early initiation of NMP may prevent NAS.

Introduction
Organ shortage remains a pressing challenge in modern medicine,
with <10% of the global demand for transplants being met[1].
This issue is exacerbated by the limitations of organ preservation
techniques, which restrict the viable window for deceased donor
transplantation. Although static cold storage (SCS) is the con-
ventional method for preserving organs by lowering cellular
metabolism[2], it does not replicate physiological conditions,
thereby increasing the risk of ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI)
and limiting preservation times. In liver transplantation, compli-
cations such as early allograft dysfunction (EAD) and non-ana-
stomotic biliary strictures (NAS) are frequently observed[3,4].
These challenges are more pronounced when donation after cir-
culatory death (DCD) or extended criteria donor (ECD) organs
are used, restricting the available donor pool[5].
HIGHLIGHTS
●A network meta-analysis highlighted the advantages of
HOPE over NMP in ECD livers.
●In HOPE, no additional benefit was observed from can-
nulating the hepatic artery.
●In NMP, increasing the proportion of perfusion time pre-
vents NAS in ECD grafts.

Systematic Review/Meta-analysis


=== PAGE 2 ===
Ex vivo liver perfusion is an emerging technology that has
several advantages over SCS. By actively circulating fluids,
machine perfusion supports metabolism, assesses viability,
extends preservation, and reduces IRI. The benefits of machine
perfusion are now established following major clinical trials[6,7],
with several European countries adopting it as the standard for
organ preservation and the US FDA approving perfusion devices
in 2021.
Beyond the benefits of machine perfusion, its indications and
protocols remain inconclusive with limited evidence. This study
aims to address three critical questions:[1] the selection of
hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE) versus normother-
mic machine perfusion (NMP) for ECD livers[2], whether to
cannulate only the portal vein or both the portal vein and
hepatic artery in HOPE, and[3] whether to initiate the perfusion
at the donor or recipient hospital.
Material and methods
Data sources and search strategy
This meta-analysis followed PRISMA[8] (Preferred Reporting Items
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) and AMSTAR[9]
(Assessing the methodological quality of systematic reviews) guide-
lines for network meta-analysis and was registered in PROSPERO.
Although ethical approval was not required, a waiver was
granted. Studies were identified by two authors in PubMed,
EMBASE, and OVID (Table S1 http://links.lww.com/JS9/
E260). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), matched non-
randomized studies (NRSs) comparing HOPE or NMP with
SCS in adult liver transplants were included. Non-comparative,
non-human, multi-organ transplant studies, and studies with
combinatorial perfusion methods were excluded. Other meta-
analyses or reviews were also examined. The risk of bias was
evaluated by two authors using the RoB2 tool for RCTs[10] and
the ROBINS-I tool[11] for NRSs. The GRADE approach was
applied to classify the certainty of evidence into high, moder-
ate, low, or very low[12]. Certainty was assessed by examining
the risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, tran-
sitivity, and related factors. Publication bias was assessed by
Egger’s and Begg’s tests. Disagreements were resolved through
discussion.
Data extraction and analysis
Two authors independently extracted data to minimize potential
bias. ECD was defined as per the provided definition[5], with
studies[13–15] that included sub-analyses of high donor risk index
(DRI) or donor-specific indications also included. Given the
inherent risk of bias in NRSs, their inclusion alongside RCTs
was justified by a predefined assessment of risk of bias and sub-
group consistency. Specifically, eligible outcomes for network
meta-analysis were selected based on initial pairwise meta-analysis
results, ensuring no significant differences between RCT and NRS
subgroups. The outcomes of interest for network meta-analysis
were selected based on the results of the initial pairwise meta-
analysis of EAD, major complications, total biliary complications
(TBC), NAS, hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT), primary non-func-
tion (PNF), post-reperfusion syndrome, acute cellular rejection
(ACR), retransplantation, acute kidney injury (AKI), renal repla-
cement therapy (RRT), hospital stay, 1-year graft loss, and 1-year
patient death. To ensure comparability, outcomes required at least
three studies in both HOPE and NMP versus SCS comparisons
and no significant publication bias. Biliary complications were
addressed by network meta-analysis of single and dual HOPE
versus SCS. For outcomes with six or more studies, rankings
based on the estimated perfusion-to-preservation time ratio of
each studies classified the bottom 50th percentile as short-term
(<p50) and the top 50th percentile as long-term (≥p50) for further
network meta-analysis and meta-regression. Definitions of out-
comes were collected from each study to address inconsistencies
in terminology (Table S2 http://links.lww.com/JS9/E260).
Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed using the gemtc
package in R Studio (v4.3.3). The deviance information criterion
was used to choose between random and fixed effects models,
selecting the fixed effects model when the difference in criteria was
≤3. Each analysis included network diagrams, and similarity was
examined by evaluating patient characteristics. Strategies were
ranked and displayed using a rankogram. Additional details
including analytical methods are provided in the supplementary
materials available at: http://links.lww.com/JS9/E260.
Results
Figure 1 illustrates the study selection process with 27 studies
eligible for systematic review and meta-analysis. In HOPE,
a total of 826 ECD liver grafts were included (388 from 5
RCTs[15–19] and 438 from 6 NRSs[20–25]), and 1041 grafts were
included in NMP (116 from 3 RCTs[7,14,26] and 925 from 7
NRSs[13,27–32]). An overview of the characteristics of the included
studies and perfusion settings is presented in Tables S3 and S4
http://links.lww.com/JS9/E260. No study directly compared
HOPE and NMP or single and dual HOPE. The time metrics
for each study, including perfusion-to-preservation time ratios,
are listed in Table S5 http://links.lww.com/JS9/E260. The over-
all risk of bias is detailed in Tables S6 and S7 http://links.lww.
com/JS9/E260. NRSs with a high risk of bias[33–35] and studies of
heterogenous populations, where ECD outcomes were not
extractable[36,37], were excluded from the meta-analysis.
A pairwise meta-analysis was carried out (Fig. S1, Table S8
http://links.lww.com/JS9/E260) as a preliminary step to the net-
work meta-analysis, selecting EAD, major complications, NAS,
TBC, ACR, retransplantation, HAT, PNF, and RRT as out-
comes of interest based on the previously stated criteria. The
deviance information criterion is in Table S9, and Figure S2
http://links.lww.com/JS9/E260 shows the per-study residual
deviance for each analysis. The certainty of evidence was compre-
hensively evaluated (Table S10 http://links.lww.com/JS9/E260).
Concerns regarding transitivity were minimal due to the restriction
of the donor population to ECDs, consistent preservation times
across control arms, and the preference of transplant centers exper-
tizing a single perfusion technique rather than varying methods for
different donor types.
HOPE and NMP vs. SCS
The network plots and rankograms for HOPE and NMP versus
SCS are presented in Figure 2 and Figure S3 http://links.lww.com/
JS9/E260, with the results summarized in Figure 3. Compared with
SCS, high-certainty evidence showed that HOPE reduced the inci-
dence of EAD [eight studies[16,18–24]; risk ratio (RR) 0.46 (95% CI
0.31–0.67)], major complications [seven studies[15,16,18,20,22–24];

0.40 (0.25–0.63)], and ACR [six studies[16,19,20,22,23,25]; 0.47
(0.27–0.80)]. Moderate-certainty evidence indicated that
HOPE reduced the risks of NAS [six studies[17,19,20,22,24,25];
0.26 (0.12–0.51)], TBC [nine studies[16–20,22–25]; 0.61 (0.43–0.87)],
retransplantation [five studies[16,18–20,24]; 0.28 (0.10–0.69)], and
HAT [five studies[16,18–20,25]; 0.49 (0.16–1.32)]. The evidence for
HOPE in reducing PNF and RRT was low. High-certainty
evidence demonstrated that NMP was associated with a lower
risk of PNF [five studies[26–29,31]; 0.17 (0.01–1.09)]. Moderate-
certainty showed that NMP lowered the risks of retransplanta-
tion [four studies[26,28,30,31]; 0.38 (0.15–0.84)] and RRT [three
studies[14,28,32]; 0.53 (0.33–0.82)]. Low to very low certainty
evidence suggested minimal difference between NMP and SCS
in preventing EAD, major complications, NAS, TBC, ACR, and
HAT for ECD liver transplantation.
Compared to NMP, HOPE showed moderate-certainty evidence
for reducing the risks of EAD [15 studies[13,14,16,18–24,26–29,31]; 0.54
(0.29–0.97)], NAS [14 studies[7,13,17,19,20,22,24–26,28,29,31,32]; 0.30
(0.12–0.71)], TBC [16 studies[13,16–20,22–29,31,32]; 0.61 (0.38–0.99)],
and ACR [10 studies[16,19,20,22,23,25,28–30,32]; 0.42 (0.21–0.81)]. The
evidence was low to very low for the superiority of HOPE in
reducing the risks of retransplantation, HAT, PNF, and RRT.
Single and dual HOPE vs. SCS
Biliary complications, including NAS and TBC, were inspected
for single- and dual-cannulated HOPE versus SCS (Fig. 4 and
Fig. S3 http://links.lww.com/JS9/E260). Compared to SCS, high-
certainty evidence demonstrated that single HOPE prevents
NAS [three studies[20,24,25]; 0.18 (0.05–0.51)] and TBC [five
studies[16,20,23–25]; 0.59 (0.37–0.95)], and moderate-certainty
evidence showed that dual HOPE prevents NAS [three
studies[17,19,22]; 0.32 (0.12–0.77)]. The certainty of evidence for
dual HOPE reducing TBC risk was low. Evidence with low to
very low certainty suggested no advantage of dual HOPE over
single HOPE in reducing NAS or TBC. The pairwise subgroup
meta-analysis for single and dual HOPE is detailed in Table S9
http://links.lww.com/JS9/E260 for all relevant outcomes.

Long-term and short-term HOPE vs. SCS
EAD, major complications, NAS, TBC, PNF, and RRT were
assessed for long-term and short-term perfusion of HOPE versus
SCS (Fig. 5 and Fig. S3 http://links.lww.com/JS9/E260). Scatter
plots present the perfusion-to-preservation time ratio of each
study and its corresponding classification into long-term or
short-term subgroups for every outcome analyzed (Fig. S4
http://links.lww.com/JS9/E260). Compared with SCS, high-
certainty evidence suggested that long-term HOPE is asso-
ciated with a lower risk of EAD [three studies[18,20,22]; 0.41
(0.22–0.74)], major complications [three studies[18,20,22]; 0.48
(0.24–0.92)], NAS [three studies[17,20,22]; 0.14 (0.02–0.56)],
and PNF [four studies[18,20,22,25]; 0.00 (0.00–0.23)]. Similar
associations were observed in short-term HOPE with EAD
[three studies[16,19,24]; 0.50 (0.29–0.84)], major complications
[three studies[15,16,24]; 0.32 (0.15–0.64)], and NAS [three
studies[19,24,25]; 0.30 (0.13–0.66)], with PNF being the exception.
Moderate-certainty evidence indicated that long-term HOPE is
associated with a reduction in TBC [four studies[16,19,24,25]; 0.53
(0.29–0.93)].
Compared to short-term HOPE, long-term HOPE was asso-
ciated with a reduced risk of PNF [seven studies[16,18–20,22,24,25];
0.00 (0.00–0.25)], supported by high-certainty evidence. For
EAD, MC, NAS, TBC, and RRT, the certainty of evidence was
low to very low regarding the superiority of long-term HOPE
over short-term HOPE. In meta-regression, the percentage of
perfusion-to-preservation time did not show a significant linear
association with the prevention of post-transplant complications
(Fig. S5 http://links.lww.com/JS9/E260).
Long-term and short-term NMP vs. SCS
Long-term and short-term NMP were compared to SCS for
EAD, major complications, NAS, and TBC (Figs 5 and S3
http://links.lww.com/JS9/E260). Scatter plots show the perfu-
sion-to-preservation time ratio and subgroup classification for
each outcome (Fig. S4 http://links.lww.com/JS9/E260). The
overall certainty of evidence was low to very low for both
long-term and short-term NMP in preventing EAD, major com-
plications, NAS, and TBC when compared to SCS. While NMP
showed limited effectiveness in ECD liver transplantation, high-
certainty evidence demonstrated that long-term NMP is more
effective in preventing NAS than short-term NMP [eight
studies[7,13,26,28,29,31,32]; 0.26 (0.07–0.93)]. In meta-regression,
no significant linear correlation was observed between the per-
centage of perfusion-to-preservation time and the reduction of
EAD, major complications, NAS, and TBC (Fig. S5 http://links.
lww.com/JS9/E260).
Discussion
This study expands on previous meta-analyses[38,39] by provid-
ing a detailed Bayesian network meta-analysis of ECD liver graft
outcomes, incorporating newly available studies and a broader
range of clinically relevant outcomes, while ensuring minimal
heterogeneity in the donor population. High-certainty evidence
demonstrated that compared with SCS, HOPE lowers the risk of
EAD, major complications and ACR, whereas NMP only
reduces the risk of PNF. Compared with NMP, HOPE showed
moderate-certainty benefits in reducing EAD, NAS, TBC, and
SCS

ACR. Single HOPE demonstrated high-certainty evidence for
reducing NAS and TBC compared to SCS, whereas dual HOPE
showed moderate-certainty benefits for NAS but lacked signifi-
cant evidence for TBC. No added benefit of dual HOPE over
single HOPE was observed. Long-term HOPE outperformed
SCS with high-certainty evidence for reducing EAD, major com-
plications, NAS, and PNF, and with moderate-certainty evidence
for TBC, while short-term HOPE showed similar benefits but low
to very low certainty for TBC, PNF, and RRT. Long-term NMP
reduced NAS compared to short-term NMP with high-certainty
evidence, but both had low to very low certainty evidence for
other outcomes.
HOPE and NMP vs. SCS
Although studies comparing HOPE and NMP are limited, the
existing literature suggests that divergent immune responses play
a crucial role. In rodent DCD transplantation models, HOPE
demonstrated reduced injury and improved survival compared
to NMP, possibly due to the alteration of non-parenchymal cell

major complications, and ACR compared to SCS, with moderate-certainty benefits for NAS, TBC, retransplantation, and HAT. The evidence for HOPE reducing
PNF and RRT was low. Although NMP reduced PNF, retransplantation, and RRT with high to moderate certainty, it showed limited overall benefit compared to
SCS for ECD liver transplantation outcomes. Compared to NMP, HOPE demonstrated moderate-certainty advantages in reducing EAD, NAS, TBC, and ACR,
while evidence for its superiority in retransplantation, HAT, PNF, and RRT was low to very low. Overall, HOPE showed broad benefits over SCS and advantages
over NMP in key outcomes. A random-effects model was applied for retransplantation due to a deviance information criterion difference exceeding 3, while
a fixed-effects model was used for all other outcomes. HOPE, hypothermic oxygenated perfusion; NMP, normothermic machine perfusion; SCS, static cold
storage; EAD, early allograft dysfunction; ACR, acute cellular rejection; NAS, non-anastomotic biliary stricture; TBC, total biliary complications; HAT, hepatic

phenotypes and downstream signaling pathways during
normothermic perfusion[40]. Data from an ongoing RCT
(NCT04644744) suggest that NMP leads to a significant rise
in circulating leukocytes, whereas HOPE perfusate contains
fewer granulocytes but a higher proportion of those expres-
sing programmed death-ligand 1[41].
Our study builds on these findings by providing clinical evi-
dence through a network meta-analysis that combines studies
with low-to-moderate bias and minimal heterogeneity, further
supported by pairwise meta-analysis results. The consistent
advantages of HOPE over NMP across various outcomes sug-
gest that HOPE provides superior protection against IRI in ECD
livers. However, immunological response during normothermic
perfusion differs between donor types and the quality of the
grafts, as shown in both rodent[40] and human liver studies[42].
Therefore, it is premature to claim that HOPE is generally super-
ior to NMP outside of ECD grafts without further subgroup
analyses of non-ECD grafts (Fig. S6A http://links.lww.com/
JS9/E260) or high-DRI and low-DRI grafts, as performed by
Grąt et al[15].
While HOPE might hold an edge in addressing post-trans-
plant complications of ECD grafts, the distinct proponents for
each method should not be overlooked. One of the major
strengths of NMP is its capacity to extend preservation time
compared to HOPE, as demonstrated in Table S5 http://links.
lww.com/JS9/E260. This prolonged preservation window not
only facilitates logistical flexibility in organ allocation and trans-
plantation but also provides additional time for viability assess-
ment, potentially reducing the risk of graft discard. This was
observed in three major RCTs[7,14,37] on normothermic perfu-
sion, with meta-analysis revealing a significant increase (Fig. S6B
http://links.lww.com/JS9/E260). Despite the Zurich group pro-
posing that mitochondrial flavin mononucleotide in the HOPE
perfusate can predict liver function and graft outcomes[43],
further human trials are needed to confirm its clinical value
over NMP. Overall, the current evidence suggests that HOPE
should be prioritized for high-risk donors, while NMP may
be more suitable in settings where extended preservation is
needed due to the geographical distance between donor and
recipient.
Single and dual HOPE vs. SCS
The question of whether to perform machine perfusion via the
portal vein alone or both the portal vein and hepatic artery
remains debatable[44–46]. Anatomically, the intrahepatic biliary
tree is supplied by both the portal vein and hepatic artery,
whereas the extrahepatic portion is mainly supplied by the peri-
biliary vascular plexus that arises from the hepatic artery[47]. In
normothermic settings where cellular metabolism is active, a dual
blood supply is necessary to preserve biliary function[48,49]. In
contrast, oxygen demand is reduced in hypothermic perfusion,
and several groups have suggested that single-portal vein can-
nulation is adequate for restoring ATP in liver cells, including
extrahepatic cholangiocytes[46,50]. Concerns also arise with the
cannulation of the hepatic artery as it can cause mechanical
damage to endothelial cells and potentially lead to arterial
complications.
A retrospective cohort study, excluded from the current
study, demonstrated that compared to single HOPE, dual
HOPE reduced biliary complications and the need for surgical
revisions[51]. However, the authors acknowledged that selection
bias is inevitable, as surgeons are likely to choose livers with
more preserved hepatic arteries for dual HOPE. Although the
need for RCTs is clear, conducting one may be challenging since
many centers have established preferences and randomization to
an unaccustomed method could present practical barriers. In
this study, the network meta-analysis of SCS, single HOPE,
and dual HOPE found no indirect evidence supporting dual
HOPE over single HOPE. Overall, our findings suggest that
single HOPE is clinically non-inferior to dual HOPE.
Long-term and short-term NMP vs. SCS
The machine perfusion system integrates multiple specialized
devices, such as pumps, an oxygenator, a heat exchanger, and
a reservoir. Owing to its complexity, transporting the system to
and from the donor hospital requires both a technical team and
a modified ambulance with an internal power supply. Many
centers have adopted a practical approach to HOPE using
short-term end-ischemic HOPE followed by SCS. This practice
may be explained by rapid mitochondrial reprogramming

Figure 4. Network meta-analysis comparisons of single and dual cannulated HOPE versus SCS in ECD liver transplantation. The forest plot is scaled from 0 to 2.5, where the box
(blue: HOPE, red: NMP, and skyblue: indirect estimate) indicates the risk ratio and the black line represents the 95% CI. Analysis of NAS and TBC for single portal
vein HOPE and dual portal vein and hepatic artery HOPE versus SCS revealed high-certainty evidence for single HOPE in reducing NAS and TBC. Moderate-
certainty evidence supported dual HOPE for NAS, but evidence for its effect on TBC was low. Dual HOPE showed no significant benefit over single HOPE with
low to very low certainty. All outcomes were analyzed using a fixed-effects model. HOPE, hypothermic oxygenated perfusion; NMP, normothermic machine
perfusion; SCS, static cold storage; NAS, non-anastomotic biliary stricture; TBC, total biliary complications; and ECD, extended criteria donor.
